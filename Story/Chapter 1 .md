# FADE IN: Scene 1

## INT. DARK CHAMBER – DREAM SEQUENCE

*The sound of dripping water. The clinking of iron shackles.*

*A dimly lit chamber—**stone walls**, damp and ancient, like a **prison beneath a forgotten kingdom**. Torches flicker, casting eerie shadows across the bloodstained floor.*

*JOHNATHAN stands in the center, bound in iron chains. His chest rises and falls rapidly. He’s **dressed in camel skin rags**, breathing heavily, his mind racing. He doesn’t know how he got here—only that **he isn’t alone.***

*There are others… **dozens of men in chains** lined up beside him. Some **whisper prayers**, others **weep silently**. A few stare **blankly ahead**, their fate already accepted. The air is thick with the **stench of fear.***

*A booming voice echoes through the chamber—cold, commanding.*


**EXECUTIONER (O.S.)**  
*"Bring the next one."*

*A door creaks open, and **a guard yanks a prisoner from the line.** The man **struggles**—screaming, pleading—but it doesn’t matter. The guard **drags him forward**, past Johnathan, toward a **massive stone block** at the front of the chamber.*

*Johnathan watches, frozen, his pulse pounding in his ears. He **knows what’s coming.** He tries to move, but **his body won’t obey**. It’s as if he’s anchored in place, **forced to witness.***

*A HOODED EXECUTIONER steps forward, raising a massive **iron axe**. The prisoner’s head is forced down onto the **stone block**. He **screams for mercy.** The crowd of onlookers—nobles dressed in dark robes—**watches in silence.***

*Then—*

**SHHHHHRK!**  

*The blade comes down in a single, brutal motion. Blood splatters across the stone. The body **twitches once**—then goes still.*

*Johnathan **gasps**, heart hammering. He tries to look away, but he **can’t.** He can **feel the warmth of the blood** on his skin. It’s real. It’s all too real.*

*And then… the guard’s eyes turn to him.*

**GUARD**  
*"Next."*

*The chains around Johnathan’s wrists tighten. He’s being **pulled forward.** He **fights**, but it’s **futile.** His **feet scrape against the stone** as the guards drag him toward the execution block.*

*The prisoners beside him whisper urgently—some **cry his name.** Others **bow their heads.***

*A voice—a deep, unshakable voice—**whispers in Johnathan’s mind.***  



**UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)**  
*"You know how this ends."*  

*Johnathan **grits his teeth**, thrashing against the guards. But their grip is **unbreakable.***

*The stone block awaits. The **executioner’s blade glistens**, wet with blood.*

**EXECUTIONER**  
*"Kneel."*

*Johnathan is **forced down**. His **cheek presses against the cold stone**. The executioner **raises the axe** high above his head.*

*Johnathan’s **breath quickens.** This isn’t just a dream. **This has happened before.** He’s **been here.** He’s **felt this.***

*A thought cuts through his fear, clear as thunder—*

*"This is how John .....  died."*

*And then—*

**SHHHHHRK!**

# SMASH CUT TO:

## INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT

*Johnathan jolts **upright** in bed—**GASPING, DRENCHED IN SWEAT.** His breath comes in **ragged, panicked bursts.** The dim glow of a bedside lamp flickers on.*

*Beside him, **his girlfriend stirs**, her hand **instantly reaching for him.***  

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"Babe? Johnathan—hey, hey, it’s okay!"*  

*She **cups his face**, worry deep in her wide, **blue eyes**. Johnathan **doesn’t answer**—he’s **staring at his hands.** They **tremble.** He **swears he can still feel the chains.** The coldness of the stone. The final moment before the blade…*

*He shudders. Swallows hard. Finally **meets her gaze**.*

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"Was it the dream again?"*  

*Johnathan **runs a hand through his damp hair**. His **chest rises and falls, his heartbeat still erratic.** He finally nods, voice **hoarse.***

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Yeah. Same one."*  

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"Baby, that’s the third time this week."*  

*She moves closer, resting a **gentle hand on his arm.** Her concern is real—but Johnathan is barely listening. His **mind is still trapped** in that chamber, **that moment.***

*He forces a breath, leans forward, elbows on his knees.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"I’ve been having these dreams since I was a kid."*  

*He looks at her, **eyes shadowed.** There’s something deeper in his voice now—**a fear he won’t admit.** A truth he doesn’t want to say aloud.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"But this one… it’s getting worse."*

*She hesitates. Then—softly, carefully—*  

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"What if it means something?"*

*Johnathan **stiffens.** His jaw tightens. He **shakes his head.***  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"It doesn’t."*

*But even as he says it—**he knows he’s lying.***

# FADE IN: Scene 2

## INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT

*The soft hum of the city outside. The bedside lamp **casts a warm glow**, flickering slightly as **Rebecca** watches Johnathan, concern still etched on her face.*

**REBECCA**  
*"You sure you're okay?"*

*Johnathan exhales slowly, rubbing his face with both hands. His body still **feels the weight** of the dream—**the chains, the cold stone, the final moment.** But he nods anyway.*

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Yeah… yeah, I’m good."*

*She **doesn’t believe him,** but she also knows pushing won’t get her anywhere. Instead, she **brushes a hand over his arm, squeezing gently.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"Come back to bed."*

*He hesitates, eyes lingering on the **dimly lit clock**—**4:37 AM.** Then, finally, he sighs and **slides back under the covers.** Rebecca turns off the lamp, settling against him.*

*As his eyes close, he whispers—almost to himself—*

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"It felt real."*

*Rebecca, half-asleep now, murmurs back—*

**REBECCA**  
*"Dreams always do."*

*But deep down, Johnathan **knows better.***

---

## INT. JOHNATHAN'S APARTMENT – MORNING

*A **sharp alarm buzzes.** The city is alive now—**cars honking, distant voices, the sizzle of bacon in a nearby apartment.** Rebecca moves around the kitchen, pouring coffee, while Johnathan finishes tying his **black techwear boots.***  

*She slides his mug toward him as he steps up to the counter, **grabbing a quick sip.** His face is still groggy, but he’s forcing himself into **work mode.** Rebecca eyes him over her own coffee.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Better sleep?"*

**JOHNATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Barely."*

*Before she can say anything else, **a car horn blares from outside.** Johnathan checks the time—**Malcolm’s here.** He downs the rest of his coffee, grabs his **EdenTech badge,** and heads for the door. Rebecca follows.*

---

## EXT. BROOKLYN STREET – MORNING

*A sleek **black sedan** idles at the curb. **Malcolm Grant**, always **calm under pressure**, leans against the driver’s side, scrolling through his phone. He looks up as **Johnathan and Rebecca step outside.***  

**MALCOLM** *(grinning)*  
*"You look like hell, man."*

*Rebecca **side-eyes Malcolm** as she walks toward her own car.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Make sure he actually stays awake at work."*

*MALCOLM smirks, **tipping an imaginary hat.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yes, ma’am. Keeping him in check is my full-time job."*

*Rebecca shakes her head with a **knowing smile** before getting into her car. Johnathan opens the **passenger door** and climbs in.*

---

## INT. MALCOLM’S CAR – DRIVING – MORNING

*The city rushes past as Malcolm **navigates the morning traffic.** A faint **hip-hop instrumental** plays low in the background. Johnathan leans back, still trying to shake off the **lingering unease** from the dream.*  

*MALCOLM glances over.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You good? You actually look worse than usual."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(scoffs, shaking his head)*  
*"Didn’t sleep much."*

*MALCOLM doesn’t push it. Instead, he shifts gears—both literally and figuratively.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yo, so you hear the buzz? The **promotion spot** is officially open."*

*That gets Johnathan’s attention. He **glances over**, expression neutral.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"You putting in for it?"*

*MALCOLM smirks but doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, he takes a turn, fingers **tapping the steering wheel.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"I mean… I should be a **top choice.** But you know how these corporate types are."*  

*Johnathan huffs a **short laugh, shaking his head.***  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"You saying it’s rigged?"*

**MALCOLM** *(shrugging)*  
*"I’m saying... **who they pick and why** ain't always about skill."*

*Johnathan leans his head against the **window**, watching the city blur past. He **knows Malcolm's right.** He also knows **he could gun for it himself.** But something in him hesitates.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"What about you? You throwing in?"*

*A pause. Johnathan exhales, rubbing his jaw before finally answering—*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Haven’t decided."*

*MALCOLM gives him a **knowing look** but lets it go. Instead, he **switches topics.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You hear about the **new project**?"*

**JOHNATHAN** *(glancing over)*  
*"The archaeology thing?"*

**MALCOLM** *(nodding)*  
*"Yeah. Word is, **EdenTech’s bringing in artifacts** from a major excavation overseas. Higher-ups been *real* hush-hush about it, but IT’s already on **security lockdown mode.** Whatever it is, it’s big."*

*Johnathan’s **brows furrow slightly.** The word **artifacts** stirs something... **uneasy.** He shifts in his seat.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"You know what they found?"*

*MALCOLM shakes his head, gripping the wheel a little tighter.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Not yet. But **Shaw’s running point.**"*

*A **brief silence** follows. They both know—**if Gregory Shaw is involved, it’s more than just old bones.***  

*The car slows as they **approach EdenTech headquarters**, the **massive glass skyscraper** reflecting the morning sun. Malcolm pulls into the underground parking lot, killing the engine.*

*MALCOLM leans back, throwing a smirk at Johnathan.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So… **promotion or not?**"*

*Johnathan unbuckles, **smirking faintly but keeping his answer to himself.** He pushes the door open and steps out.*

# FADE IN: Scene 3

## INT. EDENTECH HEADQUARTERS – MAIN LOBBY – MORNING

*A **futuristic corporate tower**, sleek and modern, its **glass façade reflecting the city skyline**. Inside, the lobby is a blend of **advanced security checkpoints, biometric scanners, and digital displays cycling through corporate achievements.** Employees in **tailored business attire** and **high-tech ID badges** move with purpose.*

*Johnathan and Malcolm step through the rotating glass doors. A **holographic interface** scans their badges as they pass security.*

**SECURITY AI (V.O.)**  
*"Welcome, Johnathan Reeves. Welcome, Malcolm Grant."*

*MALCOLM smirks, adjusting his blazer.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Gotta love a job that knows your name before you even say it."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Yeah. Real personal touch."*

*As they walk toward the elevators, a few **colleagues glance their way**, exchanging nods. **Everyone knows about the open promotion.** The air is charged with **silent competition.***  

**MALCOLM** *(leaning in, voice low)*  
*"They’re watching. All of them."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(smirks)*  
*"Let them. I plan on winning."*

*MALCOLM chuckles, shaking his head as they step into the **elevator**. The doors slide shut, and the soft hum of ascent fills the silence.*

---

## INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY FLOOR – MORNING

*The elevator doors open to reveal a **high-tech cybersecurity division**—**glass walls, digital security feeds, real-time cyber threat monitors** glowing in blue and green hues. A few employees glance up before returning to their workstations.*

*At the center of the floor, **TESSA VARGAS** sits at her desk, casually **spinning a stylus between her fingers** while skimming through **multiple security logs.** Dressed in a **stylish yet functional ensemble**, she gives off an air of **effortless confidence.***  

*As Johnathan and Malcolm approach, she leans back, eyebrow raised.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Look at you two—our very own **gladiators of corporate warfare.** Should I start placing bets?"*

*MALCOLM smirks, dropping into his chair.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Please. You already know who the house favorite is."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(grinning)*  
*"Yeah—me."*

*Tessa lets out a **mock gasp** before giving Johnathan a **playful shove** on the shoulder.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Oh? Big talk. But I dunno, John, you sure you can handle the pressure? Malcolm here’s already **rehearsing his victory speech.**"*

*MALCOLM gestures lazily, pretending to adjust a **nonexistent tie** as if addressing a boardroom.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to thank myself for always believing in me—"*

*Johnathan rolls his eyes, shaking his head with a **chuckle** as he sets down his bag and powers up his workstation. His monitor floods with **security alerts, protocol assignments, and project directives.** One notification catches his eye.*  

---

## ON SCREEN: **NEW PROJECT INITIATIVE – SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED**  

*Johnathan **narrows his eyes** as he clicks the notification. The system **flashes red**—ACCESS DENIED. The project name is simply listed as:*

### **"ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTAKE & SECURITY PROTOCOLS"**

*MALCOLM notices and leans over.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You seeing this?"*

*Johnathan **nods**, drumming his fingers on the desk. Tessa, now curious, **spins her chair toward them.***  

**TESSA**  
*"Ohhh, what’s got you two all serious?"*

*MALCOLM gestures toward Johnathan’s screen.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Rumor’s true. Something big is coming in."*

*Tessa frowns, sitting up straighter.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Big like **VIP big**, or big like **'we need to start asking questions' big?**"*

**JOHNATHAN** *(thoughtful)*  
*"Not sure yet. But if they’ve got **security access locked down** before the briefing, it’s serious."*

*MALCOLM smirks, arms crossed.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"They’re bringing **artifacts** in from a dig site in Israel. Some deal EdenTech locked in. Our job? **Make sure nothing leaks, nothing goes missing.**"*

*Tessa whistles low.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Huh. So they found something worth hiding."*

*MALCOLM shrugs.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Or something worth **protecting**."*

*A beat of silence. Johnathan stares at the **red-denied access screen**, a strange **unease curling in his gut.** He doesn’t know why, but something about this project feels... **different.***

*Before he can dwell on it, an **intercom announcement** crackles overhead.*  

---

## INTERCOM (V.O.):  
*"All division leads and select personnel, report to **Executive Conference Room 47** for **corporate briefing.**"*

*MALCOLM smirks, tossing his **badge lanyard** around his neck.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Guess we’ll be getting some answers after all."*

*Tessa watches as **Johnathan lingers**, still staring at his monitor. She leans in slightly.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Hey. You okay?"*

*Johnathan blinks, snapping out of his thoughts. He exhales and nods.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Yeah. Just thinking."*

**TESSA** *(grinning as she stands)*  
*"Dangerous habit, my friend."*

*MALCOLM claps Johnathan’s shoulder as they head for the exit.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Come on, man. Let’s see what kind of **ancient treasure** they’re dropping in our laps."*

*As the trio walks toward the **executive briefing room**, Johnathan can’t shake the feeling that whatever they’re about to learn—it’s only the beginning.*

# FADE TO BLACK.






















# **FADE IN:** (scene unknown)

### **INT. EDEN TECH HEADQUARTERS – EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM – NIGHT**  

*A **high-rise office tower in Manhattan**, glass windows overlooking the city skyline. The **Eden Tech** logo—a sleek, minimalist tree with data branches—glows on a **digital wall display**. The atmosphere is tense but professional.*  

*The **Cybersecurity Division’s Manager**, **MARCUS LANCASTER**, stands at the head of the long, polished **conference table**, addressing a select group of senior executives. His presence commands attention—not because of force, but because of experience. A seasoned leader with **a reputation for discipline**, Marcus is **known for fairness but never weakness.** Tonight, he has a difficult choice to present.*  

*Seated across from him are the two candidates for **Assistant Head Manager of Cybersecurity**: **JOHNATHAN REEVES** and **MALCOLM GRANT**.*  

- **JOHNATHAN**, late 20s, sharp and composed. His **navy techwear suit** is sleek but functional, reflecting his mindset—modern, efficient, always ready. His **eyes scan the room**, reading every movement, calculating every possible outcome. He looks calm, but inside, his thoughts are a rapid-fire sequence of probabilities.  
- **MALCOLM**, slightly older, equally competent but more relaxed. His confidence comes from **natural leadership and instinct**, where Johnathan’s comes from **strategy and precision**. Their competition has been **close, but not bitter**—a rivalry formed from **mutual respect.**  

*At the end of the table, **GREGORY SHAW**, the CEO of **Eden Tech**, watches with quiet interest. His **presence is subdued but undeniable**—like a shadow cast over the entire room. No one in the company fully understands him, but **his influence is absolute**. He rarely speaks unless necessary, and when he does, **his words are never wasted.** Tonight, he lets Marcus take the lead.*  

---

### **MARCUS LANCASTER (Cybersecurity Manager)**
*"Gentlemen, you both know why we're here. This company doesn’t just hire the best—we **forge** the best. And this division needs a leader who doesn’t just solve problems, but sees them before they exist."*  

*Johnathan and Malcolm exchange a glance. This could go either way.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"I’ve watched both of you grow into exceptional professionals. Malcolm—you bring experience, instinct, and leadership. Johnathan—you bring **technical mastery, innovation, and precision**. Either one of you could take this position and make it stronger."*  

*A pause. The tension in the room thickens. Marcus turns to Shaw, who gives the slightest nod—silent permission to proceed.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"But there’s only one seat at the table."*  

*A beat. The decision is about to drop.*  

---

### **JOHNATHAN’S INTERNAL THOUGHTS:**  
- *Anticipate the announcement. Expect probabilities. If I get it, act with controlled humility. If I don’t, conceal disappointment. This is a game. Always a game.*  
- *Don’t look at Malcolm—he’s my competition but not my enemy.*  
- *What does Shaw think? He never reacts. Never reveals anything.*

# **FADE IN:**

## **INT. EDEN TECH HEADQUARTERS – EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM – NIGHT**  

*MARCUS LANCASTER stands firm at the head of the conference table, eyes moving between the two candidates. Silence hangs in the room, thick and weighty, before he finally speaks.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"The board has made its decision."*  

*The room tenses. Even those who are just observers hold their breath.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"Effective immediately, **Johnathan Reeves** is being promoted to **Assistant Head Manager of the Cybersecurity Division**."*  

*A beat. Then a polite but subdued round of applause. The decision is made.*  

*Johnathan, ever composed, absorbs the moment with a measured nod. He stands, offering his hand first—not to Marcus, but to Malcolm.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Hell of a race, huh?"*  

*Malcolm hesitates for only a second before gripping Johnathan’s hand. There’s a smile—genuine, but tight-lipped.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah. Real close."*  

*A silent acknowledgment passes between them. The congratulations are there, but so is the reality—**one of them won, and the other didn’t**.*  

*Gregory Shaw, still seated at the far end of the table, watches with **unreadable interest**. He offers nothing more than a single nod, a quiet recognition of the outcome, before rising and stepping out of the room with a deliberate, calculated pace.*  

---

## **INT. EDEN TECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – NIGHT**  

*The Cybersecurity Division is an entirely different world from the executive floor—darker, sleek, and lined with high-tech workstations displaying live threat analyses and security protocols. A few employees glance up as **Johnathan and Malcolm step inside**, but the space remains professionally quiet.*  

*Johnathan walks toward his workstation—one he’s **spent years at**, one that now belongs to someone else. His new position means an **office of his own**, but before he can step into that future, he has to pack up the past.*  

*Malcolm lingers near his own desk but doesn’t sit. There’s a tension in the air—not hostile, but something left unsaid. Tessa Vargas, their sharp and perceptive colleague, leans against a desk nearby, arms crossed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"So, new boss. What’s the first order of business? Mandatory pizza parties?"*  

*Johnathan huffs a short laugh, shaking his head as he starts shutting down his system, reaching for his personal belongings—a **notebook, a few personal cables, an old USB drive** he barely remembers why he kept.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"First order of business? I’m heading home."*  

**TESSA**  
*"Wow. Power goes straight to your head, huh?"*  

*Malcolm, quiet up until now, exhales sharply and nods.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Well, enjoy the day off. Guess I’ll be seeing you around."*  

*He turns, heading toward his own desk, but something in his posture suggests this won’t be an easy shift. Johnathan watches for a moment before returning to his task.*  

*Packing up is quick. He’s never been one for clutter. The last thing he grabs is his **badge**—the one that **now holds more access than it did this morning**. He slides it into his pocket, slings his bag over his shoulder, and takes a last look around before stepping away from the desk he’s occupied for years.*  

*As he heads for the exit, Tessa calls after him.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Hey, don’t get too comfortable. The higher up you go, the easier it is to fall."*  

*Johnathan pauses, processing that. He doesn’t turn around, just smirks faintly before walking through the doors and into the city beyond.*
