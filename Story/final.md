## **EXT. JERUSALEM – HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – NIGHT**

*A **dusty wind** moves through the excavation site, the remnants of **Herod’s Temple** standing as a **monument of history and ruin.** The night air carries a faint scent of **earth and stone**, as if time itself lingers over the ruins. Beneath the harsh glare of **floodlights**, archaeologists, preservationists, and excavation engineers work meticulously, unearthing layers of **forgotten history** buried under centuries of debris.*

*A **temporary research tent** flaps in the wind, illuminated from within. Inside, **holographic projections and satellite imaging** overlay historical maps, reconstructing what once stood before the **Roman destruction of 70 CE.***  

---

## **INT. TEMPORARY FIELD HQ – NIGHT**

*Dr. **Marcus Strauss**, late 50s, sharp yet weary, stands over a **digital reconstruction of Herod’s Temple**. The holo-display flickers, showing **layers of the ancient structure**, each level containing the **secrets of an empire lost to war.***  

*Across from him, **Dr. Eva Mendez**, early 40s, intelligent, methodical, and **deeply invested in this discovery**, studies the **rotating 3D model** with keen interest.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(studying the model)*  
*"Standing here, beneath this ruin, you realize… Herod’s Temple was never truly sacred, was it?"*

*Strauss exhales, adjusting his glasses as the projection zooms in on the **inner court.** His voice is measured, but there’s something **distant** in his tone.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"It was a monument to power. Built not by a king of divine appointment, but by an **Edomite ruling in the place of Israelites**. A man whose bloodline was only permitted rule because of **forced conversion generations prior.**"*

*Mendez tilts her head slightly, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"John Hyrcanus. The Hasmonean ruler who forced the Edomites to accept Judaism?"*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(nodding)*  
*"Yes. After Judea expanded under his reign, the Edomites—**Herod’s ancestors**—were forcibly converted. But power doesn’t change lineage. Herod was **never truly accepted** by the people. His temple? It was **not built in reverence to the God of Israel, but to secure legitimacy** through grandeur."*

*Mendez crosses her arms, eyes narrowing slightly.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"A temple meant to cement his **political rule**, not for true worship. And yet, it still became the center of revolts."*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(exhaling deeply)*  
*"Because he ruled a people that would never fully accept him. That’s why he married into the **Hasmonean dynasty.** Mariamne I—the last true Israelite princess."*

*Mendez raises a brow, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"So he tried to **legitimize his rule** through marriage?"*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(grimly)*  
*"Yes. But when power is your only god, there can be no rivals. Herod **murdered Mariamne, killed his own children, and erased any bloodline** that could claim true Hasmonean heritage. Later, he **remarried into his own people**, ensuring his dynasty would be purely Edomite going forward."*

*Mendez shakes her head, watching the **holo-display shift** to the Roman siege of 70 CE.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(softly, thinking aloud)*  
*"So why do we still keep his traditions?"*

*Strauss exhales through his nose, leaning back against the table.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Because he was **raised among Israelites**, studied under their teachers, learned their ways. And when he seized power, he **ensured their customs remained**—even after his bloodline had been purged from their midst. The rituals, the priesthood, even aspects of religious governance today… all carry remnants of **Herod’s reign.**"*

*Mendez watches him carefully, sensing something unspoken beneath his words.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"And yet, we never discuss this in academia."*

*Strauss lets out a short, humorless chuckle.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(dryly)*  
*"No. Because if you speak of this, the **historical community will deny it, ostracize you, cut your career off.** These facts exist, but they are... inconvenient."*

*Mendez considers that, staring at the flickering holo-image of Herod’s Temple. The wind outside rattles the tent walls, as if the past itself refuses to stay buried.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(quietly, almost to himself)*  
*"Sigh... we have a lot to pay for if retribution is ever demanded and required of us."*  

*A long silence lingers. Then—*  

*A sharp **beep** from his radio interrupts the moment.*  

**FIELD ARCHAEOLOGIST (V.O.)** *(urgent, over radio)*  
*"Dr. Strauss, we’ve found something. You need to see this."*

*Mendez and Strauss exchange a glance before stepping outside.*

## **EXT. HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – MAIN EXCAVATION AREA – NIGHT**

*A team of **archaeologists and preservationists** gathers around a **partially unearthed vault**, deep within the **foundation of Herod’s Temple**. The **ancient stone casing** has been **sealed for centuries**, its inscriptions **barely legible** beneath layers of dust and time.*  

*A nervous **field assistant** wipes sweat from his forehead as Strauss and Mendez arrive.*  

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"We were stabilizing the lower chamber when we uncovered this vault. It doesn’t match the Roman-era structures—it’s **older**."*

*Mendez crouches beside the stone lid, carefully brushing away **centuries of debris.** Her eyes narrow as she deciphers the faded engravings.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(reading)*  
*"High Priest... garments… preserved... holy relics?"*  

*Strauss watches as another **team member carefully pries the lid open.** The stone **groans in protest**, releasing a **stale gust of air**—the first breath this chamber has taken in **two thousand years.***  

---

## **INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – NIGHT**

*Inside the vault, **several artifacts lay preserved in the dust**—small fragments of history untouched by time. The team moves carefully, cataloging each discovery.*  

### **ITEMS FOUND IN THE VAULT:**
✔ **A golden goblet** – engraved with **priestly symbols**, possibly used in **rituals of purification.**  
✔ **A set of weighted scales** – small, but **perfectly balanced**, believed to have been used in **temple offerings.**  
✔ **A faded scroll fragment** – wrapped in deteriorating leather, the text too fragile to decipher.  
✔ **A tattered garment** – aged beyond recognition, but **fibers reveal it to be camel’s hair.**  

*Mendez holds up the **camel’s hair garment**, frowning.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"This… isn’t temple priest attire."*

*Strauss’ eyes drift to the **last artifact**—a **small, tarnished breastplate**, forgotten in the dust.*  

*Unlike the other artifacts, it isn’t **gold-plated or extravagant**. It looks… **simple. Ancient.** Overlooked.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(thoughtful, to himself)*  
*"And yet… it’s here."*

*Mendez glances at him, sensing the weight of the moment.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Should we mark it for high priority?"*  

*Strauss hesitates, then shakes his head.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"No. It’s not the primary find."*  

*Mendez nods, but something **lingers** in her gaze. This chamber held more than **forgotten relics.** It held a **forgotten truth.***
