# **FADE IN:**
## **Chapter 1: Scene 1**

## EXT. JERUSALEM – HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – NIGHT  

*A **dusty wind** moves through the excavation site, the remnants of **Herod’s Temple** standing as a **monument of history and ruin**. The night air carries a faint scent of **earth and stone**, as if time itself lingers over the ruins. Beneath the harsh glare of **floodlights**, archaeologists, preservationists, and excavation engineers work meticulously, unearthing layers of **forgotten history** buried under centuries of debris.*  

*A **temporary research tent** flaps in the wind, illuminated from within. Inside, **holographic projections and satellite imaging** overlay historical maps, reconstructing what once stood before the **Roman destruction of 70 CE.** The excavation hums with quiet intensity—the feeling of a long-buried secret being pried from the earth.*  

---

## INT. TEMPORARY FIELD HQ – NIGHT  

*Dr. **Marcus Strauss**, late 50s, sharp yet weary, stands over a **digital reconstruction of Herod’s Temple**. The holo-display flickers, showing **layers of the ancient structure**, each level containing the **secrets of an empire lost to war.** He is deep in thought, his eyes scanning the projections like a man searching for something already lost.*  

*Across from him, **Dr. Eva Mendez**, early 40s, intelligent, methodical, and **deeply invested in this discovery**, studies the **rotating 3D model** with keen interest. A soft frown tugs at her lips as she focuses on the blueprint of the **inner sanctum**.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(studying the model)*  
*"Standing here, beneath this ruin, you realize… Herod’s Temple was never truly sacred, was it?"*  

*Strauss exhales, adjusting his glasses as the projection zooms in on the **inner court.** His voice is measured, but there’s something **distant** in his tone.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(quietly)*  
*"It was a monument to power. Built not by a king of divine appointment, but by an **Edomite ruling in the place of Israelites.** A man whose bloodline was only permitted rule because of **forced conversion generations prior.**"*  

*Mendez tilts her head slightly, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"John Hyrcanus. The Hasmonean ruler who forced the Edomites to accept Judaism?"*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(nodding)*  
*"Yes. After Judea expanded under his reign, the Edomites  —**Herod’s ancestors**— were forcibly converted. But power doesn’t change lineage. Herod was **never truly accepted** by the people. His temple? It was **not built in reverence to the God of Israel, but to secure legitimacy** through grandeur."*  

*Mendez crosses her arms, her expression pensive.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"A temple meant to cement his **political rule**, not for true worship. And yet, it still became the center of revolts."*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(grimly)*  
*"Because he ruled a people that would never fully accept him. That’s why he married into the **Hasmonean dynasty.** Mariamne I—the last true Israelite princess."*  

*Mendez raises a brow, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"So he tried to **legitimize his rule** through marriage?"*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(exhaling deeply)*  
*"Yes. But when power is your only god, there can be no rivals. Herod **murdered Mariamne I, killed his own children, and erased any bloodline** that could claim true Hasmonean heritage. Later, he **remarried into his own people**, ensuring his dynasty would be purely Edomite going forward."*  

*Mendez shakes her head, watching the **holo-display shift** to the Roman siege of 70 CE.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(softly, thinking aloud)*  
*"So why do we still keep his traditions?"*  

*Strauss exhales through his nose, leaning back against the table.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(quietly, almost to himself)*  
*"Because he was **raised among Israelites**, studied under their teachers, learned their ways. And when he seized power, he **ensured their customs remained**—even after his bloodline had been purged from their midst. The rituals, the priesthood, even aspects of religious governance today… all carry remnants of **Herod’s reign and his attempt to establish himself and his people as the legitimate Jews. Even to this very day.**"*  

*Mendez watches him carefully, sensing something unspoken beneath his words.*  

*A sharp **beep** from his radio interrupts the moment.*  

**FIELD ARCHAEOLOGIST (V.O.)** *(urgent, over radio)*  
*"Dr. Strauss, we’ve found something. You need to see this."*  

*Mendez and Strauss exchange a glance before stepping outside.*  

---

## EXT. HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – MAIN EXCAVATION AREA – NIGHT  

*A team of **archaeologists and preservationists** gathers around a **partially unearthed vault**, deep within the **foundation of Herod’s Temple**. The **ancient stone casing** has been **sealed for centuries**, its inscriptions **barely legible** beneath layers of dust and time.*  

*A nervous **field assistant** wipes sweat from his forehead as Strauss and Mendez arrive.*  

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"We were stabilizing the lower chamber when we uncovered this vault. It doesn’t match the Roman-era structures—it’s **older**."*  

*Mendez crouches beside the stone lid, carefully brushing away **centuries of debris.** Her eyes narrow as she deciphers the faded engravings.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(reading)*  
*"High Priest... garments… preserved... holy relics?"*  

*Strauss watches as another **team member carefully pries the lid open.** The stone **groans in protest**, releasing a **stale gust of air**—the first breath this chamber has taken in **two thousand years.***  

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – NIGHT  

*Inside the vault, **several artifacts lay preserved in the dust**—small fragments of history untouched by time. The team moves carefully, cataloging each discovery.*  

### **ITEMS FOUND IN THE VAULT:**  
✔ **A golden goblet** – engraved with **priestly symbols**, possibly used in **rituals of purification.**  
✔ **A set of weighted scales** – small, but **perfectly balanced**, believed to have been used in **temple offerings.**  
✔ **A faded scroll fragment** – wrapped in deteriorating leather, the text too fragile to decipher.  
✔ **A folded set of garments** – heavily deteriorated, the fabric nearly indistinguishable under layers of dust and decay.  

*Mendez lifts the **decayed garment**, holding it carefully.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Strange… The condition is poor, but this doesn’t look ceremonial."*  

*Strauss barely acknowledges it. His gaze is locked onto the final artifact, **half-buried in the dust**—a **small, tarnished breastplate**, seemingly overlooked among the more ornate relics.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(thoughtful, to himself)*  
*"And yet… it’s here."*  

*Mendez glances at him, sensing the weight of the moment.*  

*The wind outside howls, rattling the vault walls. The air feels heavier than before.*  

# FADE TO BLACK.

# **FADE IN**
## **Chapter 1: Scene 2** 

## **INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – DREAM SEQUENCE**  

*A suffocating darkness. The air is **damp, stale**, thick with the scent of **stone, sweat, and something deeper—something metallic.**  

*Jonathan **stands in the shadows**, heart pounding in his ears. He doesn’t know **where he is**—but his body does. His **skin prickles**, his chest **tightens** with a terror that hasn’t fully surfaced yet.*  

*A faint **torchlight flickers** against the walls, revealing **crude stone architecture**, **carved pillars**, and a **low ceiling that presses downward**. There are **no windows. No exits in sight.** Just the **weight of the earth above.***  

*Then—**the sound of chains.** A rusted **iron gate creaks open**.*  

*A group of **soldiers in armor** enters, their **faces hidden beneath shadowed helmets**. Their movements are methodical, cold. Behind them, a man is **dragged forward**, his **wrists bound by iron shackles.** His clothes are **ragged, stained with dirt and dried blood.** His **hair clings to his damp forehead**, but his back remains **straight.** He does not resist. He does not plead. He kneels before a **raised stone platform**, head lowered.*  

*A **single figure steps forward**—a man of **power**, dressed in a **dark robe** that pools at his feet. His presence is heavy, commanding, but his **face remains obscured** by the dim torchlight.*  

**COMMANDER (O.S.)**  
*"This is the will of the one above us."*  

*Jonathan **tries to move, to call out**, but his **body does not respond.** His breath is shallow, his pulse **slamming against his ribs**. He **knows this place. He knows this moment.** But why?*  

*A nearby **stone table glistens**—not with water, but with **old stains.** Used before. Used many times.*  

*The kneeling man **does not tremble**. His head tilts up slightly, and Jonathan catches a glimpse of his **eyes**—calm, resigned, unwavering.*  

*A soft, **familiar voice** brushes against Jonathan’s mind. Not from the man. Not from the soldiers. Not from the commander.*  

**UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)**  
*"You were there."*  

*Jonathan’s breath **catches.** The **room tilts, warps**, the walls **closing in, pressing against him**—*  

*A soldier **steps forward**, unsheathing a **broad, heavy blade.** The metal **sings** as it slices through the thick, stagnant air.*  

*Jonathan’s mind **screams, but no sound comes out.** He is frozen, locked inside a **memory that isn’t just a memory.***  

*The blade is lifted high—*  

**SMASH CUT TO:**  

---

## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**  

*Jonathan **jerks upright, gasping.** His lungs **struggle for air**, his body **rigid with tension**. The sheets are **damp with sweat**, sticking to his skin. His **hands tremble** against his legs.*  

*The room is **silent. Too silent.***  

*A soft movement beside him—Rebecca stirs, her voice heavy with sleep.*  

**REBECCA** *(groggy, concerned)*  
*"Jonathan…?"*  

*She reaches for him, fingers grazing his arm, but he barely reacts. His eyes are **wide, unfocused.** He’s still **there**—still in the chamber, the smell of stone and iron **lingering in his mind.***  

*Rebecca sits up slightly, frowning.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Hey, look at me — breathe."*  

*Jonathan **inhales sharply**, forcing himself back into the present. He turns, meeting her gaze, but he can tell—**she sees it. The fear. The confusion.** The fact that he is **shaken in a way he can’t explain.***  

**REBECCA** *(softer now)*  
*"The dream again?"*  

*Jonathan swallows hard, nods once. His voice is **low, hoarse** when he speaks.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Yeah… but this one was—*"  

*He stops himself. His throat tightens. He doesn’t know how to finish that sentence.*  

**Rebecca studies him, then exhales.** She’s seen this before. Too many times.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"That’s the third time this week."*  

*Jonathan runs a hand over his face, trying to shake the feeling. His mind still **echoes with the whisper**.*  

*"You were there."*  

*He looks at her now, his **expression unreadable**, but his **eyes hold something deeper**—something **unspoken.***  

**JONATHAN** *(quietly)*  
*"It felt… real."*  

*A beat. Rebecca hesitates, before finally speaking, voice soft, careful.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"What if it means something?"*  

*Jonathan’s **jaw tightens.** His hands **clench into fists.** The instinct is immediate, almost **violent.** He shakes his head, firm, dismissive.*  

**JONATHAN** *(low, almost to himself)*  
*"It doesn’t."*  

*But even as he says it—**he knows he’s lying.***  

**FADE TO BLACK.**  



# **FADE IN**
## **Chapter 1: Scene 3**


## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**

*The soft hum of the city outside. The bedside lamp **casts a warm glow**, flickering slightly as **Rebecca** watches Jonathan, concern still etched on her face.*

**REBECCA**  
*"You sure you're okay?"*  

*Jonathan exhales slowly, rubbing his face with both hands. His body still **feels the weight** of the dream—**the chains, the cold stone, the final moment.** But he nods anyway.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Yeah… yeah, I’m good."*  

*She **doesn’t believe him,** but she also knows pushing won’t get her anywhere. Instead, she **brushes a hand over his arm, squeezing gently.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"Come back to bed."*  

*He hesitates, eyes lingering on the **dimly lit clock**—**4:37 AM.** Then, finally, he sighs and **slides back under the covers.** Rebecca turns off the lamp, settling against him.*  

*As his eyes close, he whispers—almost to himself—*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"It felt real."*  

*Rebecca, half-asleep now, murmurs back—*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Dreams always do."*  

*But deep down, Jonathan **knows better.***  

---

## **INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT – MORNING**

*A **sharp alarm buzzes.** The city is alive now—**cars honking, distant voices, the sizzle of bacon in a nearby apartment.** Rebecca moves around the kitchen, pouring coffee, while Jonathan finishes tying his **black techwear boots.***  

*She slides his mug toward him as he steps up to the counter, **grabbing a quick sip.** His face is still groggy, but he’s forcing himself into **work mode.** Rebecca eyes him over her own coffee.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Better sleep?"*  

**JONATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Barely."*  

*He checks his phone, scrolling through **corporate emails and security alerts.** His brow furrows slightly—one **unread message** catches his attention.*  

**SUBJECT:**  
**ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTAKE & SECURITY PROTOCOLS – CONFIDENTIAL**  
**Access Level:** [RESTRICTED]  

*Jonathan clicks it, but before the details load—*  

**ACCESS DENIED. INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE.**  

*He blinks, staring at the **red warning screen.** Rebecca notices his expression shift.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"What’s wrong?"*  

*Jonathan shakes his head, shutting off his phone.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Nothing. Just work stuff."*  

*Before she can press further, **a car horn blares from outside.** Jonathan checks the time—**Malcolm’s here.** He downs the rest of his coffee, grabs his **EdenTech badge,** and heads for the door. Rebecca follows.*  

---

## **EXT. BROOKLYN STREET – MORNING**

*A sleek **black sedan** idles at the curb. **Malcolm Grant**, always **calm under pressure**, leans against the driver’s side, scrolling through his phone. He looks up as **Jonathan and Rebecca step outside.***  

**MALCOLM** *(grinning)*  
*"You look like hell, man."*  

*Rebecca **side-eyes Malcolm** as she walks toward her own car.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Make sure he actually stays awake at work."*  

*MALCOLM smirks, **tipping an imaginary hat.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yes, ma’am. Keeping him in check is my full-time job."*  

*Rebecca shakes her head with a **knowing smile** before getting into her car. Jonathan opens the **passenger door** and climbs in.*  

---

## **INT. MALCOLM’S CAR – DRIVING – MORNING**

*The city rushes past as Malcolm **navigates the morning traffic.** A faint **hip-hop instrumental** plays low in the background. Jonathan leans back, still trying to shake off the **lingering unease** from the dream.*  

*MALCOLM glances over.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You good? You actually look worse than usual."*  

**JONATHAN** *(scoffs, shaking his head)*  
*"Didn’t sleep much."*  

*MALCOLM doesn’t push it. Instead, he shifts gears—both literally and figuratively.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yo, so you hear the buzz? The **promotion spot** is officially open."*  

*That gets Jonathan’s attention. He **glances over**, expression neutral.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"You putting in for it?"*  

*MALCOLM smirks but doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, he takes a turn, fingers **tapping the steering wheel.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"I mean… I should be a **top choice.** But you know how these corporate types are."*  

*Jonathan huffs a **short laugh, shaking his head.***  

**JONATHAN**  
*"You saying it’s rigged?"*  

**MALCOLM** *(shrugging)*  
*"I’m saying... **who they pick and why** ain't always about skill."*  

*Jonathan leans his head against the **window**, watching the city blur past. He **knows Malcolm's right.** He also knows **he could gun for it himself.** But something in him hesitates.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"What about you? You throwing in?"*  

*A pause. Jonathan exhales, rubbing his jaw before finally answering—*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Haven’t decided."*  

*MALCOLM gives him a **knowing look** but lets it go. Instead, he **switches topics.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You hear about the **new project**?"*  

**JONATHAN** *(glancing over)*  
*"The archaeology thing?"*  

**MALCOLM** *(nodding)*  
*"Yeah. Word is, **EdenTech’s bringing in artifacts** from a major excavation overseas. Higher-ups been *real* hush-hush about it, but IT’s already on **security lockdown mode.** Whatever it is, it’s big."*  

*Jonathan’s **brows furrow slightly.** The word **artifacts** stirs something... **uneasy.** He shifts in his seat.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"You know what they found?"*  

*MALCOLM shakes his head, gripping the wheel a little tighter.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Not yet. But **Shaw’s running point.**"*  

*A **brief silence** follows. They both know—**if Gregory Shaw is involved, it’s more than just old bones.***  

*The car slows as they **approach EdenTech headquarters**, the **massive glass skyscraper** reflecting the morning sun. Malcolm pulls into the underground parking lot, killing the engine.*  

*MALCOLM leans back, throwing a smirk at Jonathan.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So… **promotion or not?**"*  

*Jonathan unbuckles, **smirking faintly but keeping his answer to himself.** He pushes the door open and steps out.*

# **Chapter 1: Scene 4**

## **EXT. EDENTECH HEADQUARTERS – ROOFTOP – EARLY MORNING**

*A **deep mechanical hum** grows in intensity as **twin helicopters** slice through the sky, their **rotors beating like war drums** against the city’s early morning silence. The **EdenTech skyscraper**, a sleek **monolith of glass and steel**, stands tall against the skyline. Its rooftop—a **designated high-security landing zone**—awaits the arrival of the **classified cargo.***  

*On the **reinforced helipad**, a **security team in black tactical gear** stands ready. Their movements are precise, methodical—**biometric scanners, weapons checks, radio confirmations.** Everything is controlled, everything is deliberate. They are **not standard corporate security**—this is **military-grade protocol.***  

*The **first helicopter descends**, its skids touching down with practiced ease. The **EdenTech insignia** gleams under the harsh floodlights as the rotor blades slowly wind down. A moment later, the **cargo bay doors slide open.***  

*A **team of armored personnel steps out first**, scanning the perimeter before **motioning for the handlers to proceed**. From within the cargo hold, a series of **reinforced black cases** are carefully moved onto **floating gurneys**, each one **marked with encrypted classification codes**. One case, in particular, **seems to demand extra attention**—its casing is **older, reinforced**, as if **it had been sealed long before EdenTech ever laid hands on it.***  

*A **second helicopter arrives**, repeating the **same calculated movements.** The air **smells of jet fuel and adrenaline.** No one speaks unnecessarily. Every action is **measured, every movement intentional.***  

*A **corporate logistics officer steps forward, verifying the manifest.** His voice is clipped, professional.*  

**LOGISTICS OFFICER**  
*"Transfer authorization confirmed. Moving artifacts to primary containment."*  

*A series of **metallic locks disengage** as the convoy begins its careful march toward the **building’s private elevator shaft.** From here, the **artifacts will be taken to their secured holding zones**—out of sight from the rest of the company, **sealed in a vault known only to the highest-clearance personnel.***  

*As the last artifact container is removed, one of the security officers **casts a lingering glance at the heavily reinforced case.** Something about it **unsettles him**, but he says nothing.*  

*The team moves inside. The rooftop is silent once more.*  

---

## **INT. EDENTECH HEADQUARTERS – MAIN LOBBY – MORNING**

*A **futuristic corporate tower**, sleek and modern, its **glass façade reflecting the city skyline**. Inside, the lobby is a blend of **advanced security checkpoints, biometric scanners, and digital displays cycling through corporate achievements.** Employees in **tailored business attire** and **high-tech ID badges** move with purpose.*  

*Jonathan and Malcolm step through the rotating glass doors. A **holographic interface** scans their badges as they pass security.*  

**SECURITY AI (V.O.)**  
*"Welcome, Jonathan Reeves. Welcome, Malcolm Grant."*  

*MALCOLM smirks, adjusting his blazer.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Gotta love a job that knows your name before you even say it."*  

**JONATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Yeah. Real personal touch."*  

*As they walk toward the elevators, a few **colleagues glance their way**, exchanging nods. **Everyone knows about the open promotion.** The air is charged with **silent competition.***  

**MALCOLM** *(leaning in, voice low)*  
*"They’re watching. All of them."*  

**JONATHAN** *(smirks)*  
*"Let them."*  

*MALCOLM chuckles, shaking his head as they step into the **elevator**. The doors slide shut, and the soft hum of ascent fills the silence.*  

---

## **INT. EDENTECH – EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM – MORNING**

*A **sleek, high-tech boardroom** with **a panoramic view of the city.** The room is dimly lit except for the glow of an **interactive holo-table** in the center. A **3D projection of an excavation site** flickers above it—**ancient ruins, stone walls, tunnels leading into darkness.***  

*Sitting at the head of the table, **GREGORY SHAW**—CEO of EdenTech. His expression is unreadable, his **hands folded calmly** as he watches the others take their seats. Around him, a mix of **executives, cybersecurity leads, and key researchers** from the archaeology team sit in anticipation.*  

*Jonathan, Malcolm, and Tessa settle into their seats near the **security team section.** The tension in the room is palpable.*  

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**  
*"We appreciate you all making time this morning. Let’s get straight to it."*  

*He gestures toward **DR. MARCUS STRAUSS**, a lead **archaeologist** in his late 50s, dressed in **practical fieldwear** despite the corporate setting. Strauss clears his throat, tapping at the **holo-table**. The **3D projection zooms in** on a specific section of the ruins.*

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"EdenTech has secured exclusive research access to an **archaeological zone near the remnants of King Herod’s temple wall.** After extensive negotiations with Israeli authorities, we’ve been granted **the first corporate-backed excavation rights** in this sector."*  

*Tessa **raises a brow, exchanging a look with Jonathan.** Corporate-backed? That’s rare.*  

*MALCOLM smirks slightly, whispering under his breath—*  

**MALCOLM** *(low voice)*  
*"Sounds expensive."*  

**GREGORY SHAW** *(calmly, without looking up)*  
*"It was."*  

*A silence settles before **Strauss continues.***  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Our team has uncovered **several artifacts** that will be transferred here for **analysis and preservation.** Your division will oversee the **cybersecurity and logistical protocols** for securing these artifacts during their transport and housing in EdenTech’s private archive."*  

*Tessa leans back slightly, arms crossed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"And what exactly are we guarding?"*  

---

## **ON SCREEN – LISTED ARTIFACTS FOR TRANSPORT**  

- **Ancient bronze relics** with unknown engravings  
- **Damaged scroll fragments** encased in protective resin  
- **Gold-plated ceremonial object** (partially restored)  
- **A piece of an ornamental breastplate** (unidentified origin)  

---

**MALCOLM** *(frowning slightly)*  
*"That last one seems… oddly specific."*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(ignoring the comment, moving on)*  
*"Each item will undergo a **multi-stage authentication process** to determine historical significance and proper handling. Until further notice, these artifacts will remain **off-record to external entities.**"*  

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**  
*"Now, as for your responsibilities—"*  

*He nods toward the **head of the cybersecurity division**, MARCUS LANCASTER, who takes over.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"Jonathan. Malcolm. Tessa. Your team will be leading the **internal security integration** for this project. That means—**surveillance, access logs, breach detection.** No one outside this room is to have clearance."*  

*A pause. Shaw observes the **entire team**—his gaze sharp, assessing. Not just Jonathan, but **all of them**.*  

*MALCOLM, ever the skeptic, exhales sharply.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So what aren’t we being told?"*  

*A flicker of something—**amusement? Calculation?**—crosses Shaw’s face before he responds.*  

**GREGORY SHAW**  
*"Nothing you need to concern yourselves with at this stage."*  

*MALCOLM holds his stare for a moment before **leaning back in his chair**, nodding slowly. The tension **lingers.***

*Jonathan stares at the last item, something about it **nagging at his subconscious.** The vague description bothers him.*  

**Jonathan** *(quietly, to himself)*  
*"Ornamental breastplate?"*

*MALCOLM, skimming the list, frowns slightly.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"That last one seems… oddly specific."*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(ignoring the comment, moving on)*  
*"Each item will undergo a **multi-stage authentication process** to determine historical significance and proper handling. Until further notice, these artifacts will remain **off-record to external entities.**"*

*Jonathan glances at Shaw, who **hasn’t spoken much.** But his gaze is sharp, watchful. Like he’s **measuring everyone’s reactions.***  

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**
*"Now, as for your responsibilities—"*

*He nods toward the **head of the cybersecurity division**, MARCUS LANCASTER, who takes over.*

*MARCUS, a **seasoned veteran in security management**, speaks with precision.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"Jonathan. Malcolm. Tessa. Your team will be leading the **internal security integration** for this project. That means—**surveillance, access logs, breach detection.** No one outside this room is to have clearance."*

*Jonathan and Malcolm exchange a look. **This just got serious.***  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"We’ll be implementing **classified protocols** for digital containment. That includes **restricted server access, biometric entry for physical storage zones, and live threat analysis.**"*

**TESSA** *(leaning forward)*  
*"So we’re treating this like **a national security asset**?"*

**GREGORY SHAW** *(calmly)*  
*"That would be an accurate comparison."*

*Another beat of **silence.** Something about Shaw’s **tone** makes the entire room feel colder. Jonathan **studies him carefully.***  

*MALCOLM, ever the skeptic, exhales sharply.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So what aren’t we being told?"*

*Shaw finally looks up, his gaze locking onto Malcolm’s with a faint, unreadable smirk.*  

**GREGORY SHAW**  
*"Nothing you need to concern yourself with at this stage."*

*MALCOLM holds his stare for a moment before **leaning back in his chair**, nodding slowly.*  

*Tessa **glances at Jonathan**, seeing the way he’s still looking at the **artifact list on the screen.** He seems... **drawn to it.***  

---

## **INTERCOM (V.O.)**  
*"Security transport for Project Athena will commence in **48 hours.** All lead personnel prepare protocols accordingly."*

*MARCUS nods, closing the **briefing session.***  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"That’s all for now. Get to work."*

*Chairs slide back. Executives file out. Strauss murmurs something to a fellow researcher. Shaw stands, straightens his **tailored suit**, and exits without another word.*  

---

## INT. EDENTECH – HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER  

*Tessa, Malcolm, and Jonathan **walk back toward their division**, the weight of the meeting **lingering.***

*MALCOLM scoffs, running a hand over his jaw.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You’re telling me we’re locking down **ancient artifacts** like they’re **nuclear launch codes**? Something’s off."*

**TESSA** *(glancing at Jonathan)*  
*"You’ve been quiet."*

*Jonathan stops mid-step, still processing. Something about **that ornamental breastplate.** His gut tells him **this isn’t just a relic.***

**Jonathan** *(finally speaking, voice low)*  
*"I think this is bigger than we realize."*

*MALCOLM gives him a look, smirking slightly.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah? You gonna start believing in **ancient curses and lost treasures** now?"*

*Jonathan doesn’t answer. He just **keeps walking.** The image of the **breastplate** still lingers in his mind… **as if he’s seen it before.***

## **INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – AFTERNOON**

*A low hum of **server racks** fills the air. Rows of **high-tech workstations** glow under dimmed blue lights, each screen flashing with **coding interfaces, network monitoring tools, and security protocols in progress.** Large **interactive displays** map out access routes and encryption layers for the upcoming **artifact transfer.***  

*Jonathan, Tessa, and Malcolm stand near the **central operations hub**, reviewing the **latest system configurations** while their team of **engineers and analysts** works around them.*  

*Tessa taps a few keys on a **touchscreen panel, scanning the system logs.***  

**TESSA**  
*"Alright, so we’re running a **segmented security model**—only **biometric clearance and direct ID authentication** can access the archives. Even **Shaw himself** has to log in with dual verification."*  

*MALCOLM, arms crossed, nods while glancing at the **encryption firewall logs.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Fine. But what about external threats? If someone tries **breaching from an outside network**, we need an **instant kill switch** before data gets compromised."*  

*Jonathan, typing rapidly on his console, speaks without looking up.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"I’m implementing a **multi-tiered fail-safe**. If an unauthorized entity tries to force their way in, the **server partitions itself**, isolating the breach before wiping volatile data."*  

*Tessa whistles, clearly impressed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Damn. You trying to build a digital Fort Knox?"*  

**JONATHAN** *(smirking, still typing)*  
*"If I do my job right, even **we** won’t be able to break in without clearance."*  

*MALCOLM, skeptical, leans over to check Jonathan’s screen.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah? What about **internal threats**?"*  

*Tessa leans back in her chair, arms behind her head.*  

**TESSA**  
*"See, that’s the real issue. We can guard **against the world**, but if someone **inside EdenTech** decides to play dirty? That’s a whole different problem."*  

*MALCOLM nods, rubbing his chin.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Exactly. And we both know **this company’s got secrets.** Hell, we’re getting locked out of half the damn logs."*  

*Jonathan doesn’t respond immediately. He knows Malcolm is right. This isn’t **just a security job**—there’s a level of **secrecy** even they aren’t being told. But instead of voicing his concern, he refocuses on his screen.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Then we build a system that makes internal leaks **traceable**. If someone **inside** tries to bypass security, we **track them in real time.**"*  

*Tessa raises a brow, intrigued.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Oh? You thinking **counter-surveillance?**"*  

*MALCOLM chuckles, shaking his head.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"My man’s out here setting traps before we even catch a rat."*  

*Jonathan smirks but keeps his focus on the monitor.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Better safe than sorry."*

*Tessa claps her hands together, pushing away from her workstation.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Alright, well… this is officially the **most secure system we’ve ever built.** Unless someone’s got magic, we should be good."*  

*MALCOLM stretches, rolling his shoulders.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Magic? Man, you been watching too many movies."*  

*Tessa smirks, standing up.*  

**TESSA**  
*"And you don’t watch enough."*  

*MALCOLM shakes his head as **the clock on the wall flashes 6:45 PM.** The workday is wrapping up. Engineers are **logging off, stretching, grabbing their stuff.** The security protocols are in place, and now, it’s just a matter of **waiting for the artifacts to arrive.***  

**MALCOLM** *(grabbing his bag)*  
*"Alright, I’m out. I got a gym session, then I’m hitting the bar. You in?"*  

*Jonathan shakes his head, shutting down his station.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Nah, I’m heading home."*  

*Tessa shrugs.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Suit yourself, bossman. Try not to dream about **firewalls and intrusion logs** tonight."*  

*Jonathan smirks, slinging his bag over his shoulder.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"No promises."*  

---

## **INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – LATE NIGHT**  

*A dim glow from **monitors and security feeds** illuminates the otherwise empty office. The floor is nearly deserted—most employees have left for the night. **Tessa Vargas**, still at her workstation, leans back in her chair, chewing on a pen cap as she scrolls through layers of **encrypted files** on her **holo-screen**.*  

*The **system hums softly**, displaying endless lines of **authorization logs and classified data archives**. Every few seconds, **Tessa glances over her shoulder**, half-expecting someone to walk in. The files she’s looking through… **she shouldn’t be looking at.***  

*Her fingers dance over the keys, **bypassing basic firewalls**, slipping past **security alerts** like a ghost. She mutters to herself—*  

### **TESSA** *(low voice)*  
*"Alright, let’s see what these corporate creeps don’t want us knowing."*  

*The **screen flickers**, the **EdenTech security database** adjusting to her **clearance bypass**. She exhales slowly—her heart pounds. She’s done **covert digging before**, but this is different.*  

*Finally, a **project archive** pops up—**old, buried records**, hidden under **obsolete classification codes**.*  

---

## **ON SCREEN:**  
### **PROJECT: ATHENA – HISTORICAL ACQUISITIONS**  
**Date:** March 2017  
**Status:** Terminated  
**Lead Investigator:** Gregory Shaw  
**Description:** Recovery & Containment of High-Risk Artifacts  
**Security Level:** Black Class Authorization  

---

*Tessa squints. **Black Class Authorization?** That’s the **highest clearance level in the company**. Even **department heads don’t get access** to those files.*  

*Her cursor hovers over the **"Open Detailed Report"** button. She hesitates.*  

*"Screw it."*  

*She clicks.*  

*Instantly, the screen **blurs with a red security warning**—*  

---

## **WARNING: ACCESS RESTRICTED. ADMINISTRATIVE OVERRIDE REQUIRED.**  
## **ATTEMPT LOGGED.**  
## **REPORTING TO SECURITY MAINFRAME.**  
## **DISCONNECTING IN 10 SECONDS.**  

---

### **TESSA** *(muttering)*  
*"Shit."*  

*She **yanks her connection line**, **killing the system feed** just before the security lockout activates. The screen **fades to black**, and for a second, there’s **nothing but silence**.*  

*Then, her **workstation reboots itself.** Like nothing ever happened.*  

*But she knows better.*  

*Tessa leans back, rubbing her face. Her mind races—what the hell did she just **almost see**?*  

*Her eyes flick toward the **security logs** she copied just before the system locked her out.*  

*And then—*  

*A faint **reflection appears on her screen**—not her own.*  

*For a split second, a **shadowy figure** stands behind her.*  

*She **whips around—nothing.** The office is empty.*  

*Tessa exhales, shivering. Whatever she just triggered… **someone knows.***

# **Chapter 1: Scene 7**
# **FADE IN**

## **INT. JONATHAN & REBECCA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

*A **soft glow from the kitchen light** spills into the darkened apartment. The faint hum of the **city outside** filters through the windows—car horns, distant sirens, the rhythmic pulse of life beyond these walls.*

*Jonathan unlocks the door, stepping inside. The scent of **roasted vegetables and seared meat** lingers in the air. Rebecca, dressed in **casual homewear**, stands by the stove, plating the last portion of dinner.*

*She glances up as he enters, offering a small smile.*

**REBECCA**  
*"Didn’t think I’d see you before midnight."*

*Jonathan **smirks faintly**, dropping his bag by the couch. His movements are **slower than usual, weighted**, as if something unseen presses on his shoulders. He rubs a hand over his face before stepping toward the counter.*

**JONATHAN**  
*"Long day?"*

**REBECCA** *(nodding, stretching her neck)*  
*"Draining. Too many emails, too many meetings. Same cycle, different day."*

*Jonathan exhales, rolling his shoulders as he takes a seat at the counter. Rebecca slides a plate toward him, watching him **closely**. His expression is distant, his focus absent. He chews absently, **his mind clearly elsewhere.***

**REBECCA** *(softly, studying him)*  
*"You didn’t hear a word I just said, did you?"*

*Jonathan looks up, blinking as if pulling himself out of a fog. He forces a half-smile.*

**JONATHAN**  
*"No, I—sorry. Just… a lot on my mind."*

**REBECCA** *(leaning forward slightly, prodding)*  
*"Work?"*

*Jonathan hesitates. He wants to say yes. That would be the easy answer. But **something in him resists lying to her.***

**JONATHAN** *(quietly)*  
*"It’s this new project. Feels… off."*

*Rebecca tilts her head slightly.*

**REBECCA**  
*"Off how?"*

*Jonathan hesitates again, gripping his fork tighter. The **artifact list, the secrecy, the unease**—it all sits in his chest like a lead weight. He exhales, shaking his head.*

**JONATHAN**  
*"Just different."*

*Rebecca watches him for a beat, then sets her fork down with a soft clink. She doesn’t press further, but her voice lowers, more grounded.*

**REBECCA**  
*"I don’t know what’s happening in that head of yours, but you’re starting to feel like a ghost in this house, Jon."*

*Jonathan’s jaw tightens. He **wants to say something—anything—but words fail him.** Instead, he nods, offering a half-hearted smile.*

**JONATHAN** *(softly)*  
*"I hear you."*

*A comfortable silence settles as they eat. But in the back of Jonathan’s mind, **the feeling doesn’t fade.** It **deepens.***

---

## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**

*A heavy **silence**. The only sound is the faint rustle of fabric as **Rebecca shifts in her sleep**, the rhythmic rise and fall of her breath.*

*Jonathan lies awake, staring at the ceiling, his body **tired but his mind restless**. His limbs feel heavy, his thoughts like static—an incessant, dull hum.*

*Then—**the sensation shifts.**  

Something **pulls.**  

His breath slows. His eyelids grow heavy. The world around him **tilts, dissolving into darkness.**  

---

## **INT. DUNGEON – ANCIENT ISRAEL – DREAM SEQUENCE**

*Jonathan **awakens suddenly—but he knows.**  

He **knows this is a dream.**  

But this time, **something is different.**  

*A **low, suffocating dampness** clings to the air. The stone walls are **slick with moisture**, a mixture of mold and decay soaking into the cracks. The only light comes from **torches flickering unevenly**, casting grotesque shadows that **dance against the walls.***  

*Jonathan’s wrists ache—**iron shackles bite into his skin.** The sensation is **too real.** His breath comes **sharp, uneven.**  

His body **remembers before his mind does.**  

And then it hits him.  

**Not just déjà vu.**  

**Recognition.**  

**He knows where he is. This is a dungeon.**  

A familiar **boom of a voice** cuts through the air.  

**GUARD (O.S.)**  
*"Bring the next one."*

*Jonathan’s **stomach tightens.** He turns his head—he isn’t alone.*  

*Rows of men **sit against the dungeon walls**, their faces **hollow, beaten, waiting.** Some **whisper prayers**, others stare blankly into the darkness. The air **smells of sweat, blood, and hopelessness.***  

*The **iron door** creaks open. A prisoner is **yanked to his feet**, his shackles dragging against the stone.*  

*Jonathan knows what comes next. But this time—**this time, he’s conscious.**  

He wants to move.  

He can’t.*  

*A raised **execution block** looms in the center of the dungeon—**a bloodstained stone platform**, worn from use. The prisoner is forced to **kneel**, his breathing ragged, his body trembling.*  

*A heavy-set **executioner**, clad in dark armor, lifts a **gleaming sword.** No hesitation. No mercy.*  

**SHHHHHRK!**  

*The **blade comes down**, and **the body crumples forward.** The head **rolls onto the stone**, its lifeless eyes still open.*  

*Jonathan gasps. He wants to wake up, but his body **stays trapped.** He feels **gravity anchoring him in place.**  

He **isn’t watching.**  

He **is living.**  

The guard turns—**his gaze lands on Jonathan.***  

**GUARD**  
*"Next."*

*Jonathan is **dragged forward.** His feet **scrape against the stone floor**, his body **powerless** against the pull of history.*  

He **has been here before.**  

And he **remembers how it ends.**  

*A shadow looms over him. The executioner grips his **shoulder**, forcing him **down onto the block.**  

**EXECUTIONER** *(low, rumbling)*  
*"Kneel."*

*Jonathan’s cheek **presses against the cold stone.** His eyes remain **locked on something just beyond the block.**  

*A **golden breastplate.** Resting on a pedestal, its **twelve stones dimly illuminated** in the flickering light.*  

Jonathan’s heart pounds harder.  

He tries to **move toward it, reach for it**, but **his body refuses.**  

The executioner’s grip tightens.  

The sword **rises.**  

Jonathan squeezes his eyes shut, **bracing for agony.**  

**Wake up, wake up WAKE UP!**  

The blade **comes down.**  

A flash of **white-hot pain.**  

---

## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**

*Jonathan **jerks upright, gasping.** His body **lurches forward**, drenched in sweat, his breath coming in **short, ragged bursts.** His hands fly to his **neck.** He’s alive. But the pain still lingers—**a phantom sensation.***  

*Rebecca stirs beside him, frowning, her voice **thick with sleep.***  

**REBECCA** *(groggy)*  
*"Jon...? What happened?"*

*Jonathan stares ahead, his fingers still **hovering over his throat.** The weight of the dream **settles in his bones.***  

His voice is hoarse. Hollow.  

**JONATHAN** *(whispering)*  
*"I didn’t wake up this time."*

*Rebecca blinks, **now fully awake.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"What?"*

*Jonathan turns to her, his voice low, shaken.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"I think I just died."*

# **Chapter 2: Scene 1**

# **FADE IN:**

## **INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION – DIMLY LIT ROOM – NIGHT**

*A vast, dimly lit chamber. Shadows stretch across the walls, cast by a single flickering chandelier overhead. The architecture is ancient—gothic columns, vaulted ceilings, and aged stone floors that bear the weight of countless secrets. A long, mahogany table sits at the center, surrounded by figures cloaked in darkness. Their faces remain obscured, but their presence is palpable.*

*Low murmurs settle as a voice, deep and authoritative, cuts through the room.*

**FIRST FIGURE**  
*(calm, measured)*  
"The world moves as we have willed it. Their minds are shaped, their history rewritten. Yet, there are... murmurs."

*A rustle among the figures, a shift in the atmosphere.*

**SECOND FIGURE**  
*(a low, rasping voice)*  
"Murmurs lead to echoes, and echoes become a storm. We have spent centuries ensuring they do not awaken. Have our methods weakened?"

**THIRD FIGURE**  
*(sharply)*  
"Not weakened—merely tested. There are always those who refuse their station. But even they must bow to what they do not understand."

**FOURTH FIGURE**  
*(mocking, amused)*  
"Like the ones before them? Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Nat Turner? Each thought they could awaken the lost ones, and each was handled accordingly."

**FIFTH FIGURE**  
*(smugly)*  
"Revolutions are expensive. Their leaders are shackled by debt or silenced with economic disparity. We ensure their chains are invisible, yet unbreakable."

**SIXTH FIGURE**  
*(gravelly, firm)*  
"And if they do rise, we meet them with force. Covert operations, engineered conflicts, precision strikes. Their movements crumble before they begin."

**SEVENTH FIGURE**  
*(soft, sinister)*  
"Their faith belongs to us. We tell them what to worship, who to trust, and what doctrines to follow. Any who challenge the narrative are branded as heretics."

**EIGHTH FIGURE**  
*(coldly, clinical)*  
"And if knowledge seeps through, we suppress it through more direct measures—disease, pharmaceuticals, mental conditioning. They are dependent on our systems to live."

**NINTH FIGURE**  
*(calculated, monotone)*  
"AI, surveillance, digital monitoring. We know what they seek before they find it. Their algorithms serve our design."

**TENTH FIGURE**  
*(smug, final)*  
"It is not enough to silence a voice. A silenced voice becomes a martyr. No, they must be *led*—guided to believe that what they seek is folly. That their past is meaningless."

**FIRST FIGURE**  
*(reflective)*  
"A people without history... is a people without identity. And a people without identity... are cattle, ripe for direction."

*A low hum of agreement rumbles through the room. The plan has worked for centuries—why should now be any different?*

**FIFTH FIGURE**  
*(skeptical)*  
"Then explain why the murmurs persist. Explain why, despite every measure, some still find the path back."

**FOURTH FIGURE**  
*(calm, yet firm)*  
"Because the past calls to them. And something... or *someone*... has begun to stir the waters."

*The air grows heavy. The weight of those words lingers. A silent understanding spreads among them—there is more at play than mere chance.*

**TENTH FIGURE**  
*(after a pause, resolute)*  
"Then we must move swiftly. Influence their leaders, shape their narratives. If they begin to seek, ensure they find only the doors we build for them. Keep their scholars indebted, their movements fragmented, their truths buried beneath the sands of irrelevance."

*A chorus of approval follows. The meeting is drawing to a close, but the unseen battle continues.*

**FIRST FIGURE**  
*(final, with certainty)*  
"We have always been the architects of their understanding. And we shall remain so."

*The chandelier flickers once, casting elongated shadows that momentarily distort against the walls. The figures rise, disappearing into the darkness one by one, their presence dissipating like mist.*

# **Chapter 2: Scene 2**

# **FADE IN:**

## **INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – LATE NIGHT**

The office is nearly empty, the usual hum of voices and keystrokes reduced to the rhythmic beeping of system monitors. The overhead lights are dimmed, leaving only the glow of multiple screens illuminating the room. Jonathan and Tessa remain, locked in their respective tasks.

Tessa leans forward, scanning through lines of security logs while Jonathan, sitting across from her, flips between network feeds and internal camera archives.

### **TESSA** *(glancing at him)*  
“You’re really burning the midnight oil, Reeves. Trying to make up for all that zoning out earlier?”  

### **JONATHAN** *(absentmindedly, still focused on the screen)*  
“Something doesn’t sit right with me about this project…”  

Tessa sighs, stretching her arms above her head.

### **TESSA**  
“Tell me about it. EdenTech doesn’t lock down regular digs like this. Whatever they found… it’s big.”  

Jonathan’s fingers hover over his keyboard, a thought forming in his mind. His curiosity sharpens. His pulse quickens as he hesitates for just a moment—then he types a **series of override commands** into the system. Tessa watches, intrigued but wary.

### **TESSA** *(smirking, but lowering her voice)*  
“You’re hacking our own security feeds now?”  

### **JONATHAN** *(focused, determined)*  
“I just want to see what the researchers were looking at. The system keeps those feeds archived but restricted… which means there’s something worth hiding.”  

Tessa leans in, watching as Jonathan bypasses the internal encryption barriers. A new window opens—a **live camera feed playback from the research lab.** The timestamp shows footage from **earlier that evening.**

On screen, Dr. Strauss and his team are gathered around a **workstation**, carefully examining the **ancient breastplate**. The light reflects off its **twelve embedded stones**, though some appear **dim and faded**. The researchers exchange words, their voices muted on the silent feed.

### **JONATHAN** *(whispering, transfixed)*  
“There it is…”  

Tessa watches him carefully. Jonathan's eyes remain fixed on the screen, but there’s something different about the way he stares. Almost like he’s searching for something beyond what’s visible.

A few beats of silence pass. Tessa leans back, rubbing her face, exhaustion settling in.

### **TESSA** *(yawning, standing up)*  
“I’m clocking out. You should too. Don’t stay here all night chasing ghosts.”  

Jonathan barely acknowledges her. His eyes remain locked onto the **breastplate** displayed on the monitor. The flickering light reflects in his pupils, unmoving.

Tessa hesitates, sensing something is off. For a moment, she considers pressing him, but she ultimately shakes her head.

### **TESSA** *(softer, almost concerned)*  
“Get some rest, Jon.”  

She exits, the sound of her footsteps fading into the distance. The door shuts behind her, leaving Jonathan alone in the dimly lit office.

---

## **INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – MOMENTS LATER**

The silence in the office deepens, stretching unnaturally long. Jonathan shifts in his seat, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. His mind races, but he isn’t thinking about the code on his screen anymore.

He swallows, his throat suddenly dry. A strange, nagging sensation tugs at him—an itch in his brain, an invisible pull tightening in his chest. He looks back at the screen.

The breastplate remains frozen in the footage, its twelve stones dull and lifeless. And yet, something about it refuses to let go of his attention. The more he stares, the more it seems to **loom larger** in his mind.

The hum of the monitors dulls, a static-like pressure building in the back of his skull. His breath shallows. His pulse pounds.

His chair scrapes against the floor as he **suddenly stands**. He doesn’t know why—his body simply **moves on its own.** He grabs his badge, his feet already carrying him toward the door before his mind can catch up.

---

## **INT. EDENTECH – HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER**

Jonathan walks slowly, almost absently, through the corridor. The dim lighting overhead flickers slightly, casting elongated shadows across the walls. His feet move of their own accord, leading him toward the **restricted research lab.**

He stops in front of the **security doors**, staring at the keypad.

His hand hovers over his badge, fingers tightening around it. His breath slows as the pull intensifies—an invisible force **urging him forward**. His pulse pounds against his ribs. His body tenses as he lifts the badge toward the scanner—

But at the last moment, he stops.

His fingers curl into fists. He presses a hand against the cold metal of the door, his pulse still pounding. A shiver runs through him. He doesn’t know what he expected—but he knows this wasn’t it.

Jonathan takes a slow step back, shaking his head. Maybe he’s losing it. Maybe he just needs sleep.

He turns on his heel, heading down the corridor toward the elevators. The weight in his chest lingers, but he forces himself forward.

---

## **INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

Jonathan steps into his dimly lit apartment, the city’s faint glow filtering through the windows. He tosses his bag onto the counter, rubbing a hand over his face.

For a moment, he just **stands there.** The silence feels heavier than usual.

He exhales, shaking his head as he moves toward his bedroom. The pull is still there, faint, lingering in the back of his mind. But the door wouldn’t open. There was nothing more he could do tonight.

As he lays down, his mind refuses to settle. The **image of the breastplate** stays burned into his vision, its stones dull yet somehow… **watching him.**

His eyes drift shut, but sleep does not come easily.
