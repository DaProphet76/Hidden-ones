### **INT. EDEN TECH HEADQUARTERS – EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM – NIGHT**  

*A **high-rise office tower in Manhattan**, glass windows overlooking the city skyline. The **Eden Tech** logo—a sleek, minimalist tree with data branches—glows on a **digital wall display**. The atmosphere is tense but professional.*  

*The **Cybersecurity Division’s Manager**, **MARCUS LANCASTER**, stands at the head of the long, polished **conference table**, addressing a select group of senior executives. His presence commands attention—not because of force, but because of experience. A seasoned leader with **a reputation for discipline**, Marcus is **known for fairness but never weakness.** Tonight, he has a difficult choice to present.*  

*Seated across from him are the two candidates for **Assistant Head Manager of Cybersecurity**: **JOHNATHAN REEVES** and **MALCOLM GRANT**.*  

- **JOHNATHAN**, late 20s, sharp and composed. His **navy techwear suit** is sleek but functional, reflecting his mindset—modern, efficient, always ready. His **eyes scan the room**, reading every movement, calculating every possible outcome. He looks calm, but inside, his thoughts are a rapid-fire sequence of probabilities.  
- **MALCOLM**, slightly older, equally competent but more relaxed. His confidence comes from **natural leadership and instinct**, where Johnathan’s comes from **strategy and precision**. Their competition has been **close, but not bitter**—a rivalry formed from **mutual respect.**  

*At the end of the table, **GREGORY SHAW**, the CEO of **Eden Tech**, watches with quiet interest. His **presence is subdued but undeniable**—like a shadow cast over the entire room. No one in the company fully understands him, but **his influence is absolute**. He rarely speaks unless necessary, and when he does, **his words are never wasted.** Tonight, he lets Marcus take the lead.*

### **MARCUS LANCASTER (Cybersecurity Manager)**
*"Gentlemen, you both know why we're here. This company doesn’t just hire the best—we **forge** the best. And this division needs a leader who doesn’t just solve problems, but sees them before they exist."*  

*Johnathan and Malcolm exchange a glance. This could go either way.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"I’ve watched both of you grow into exceptional professionals. Malcolm—you bring experience, instinct, and leadership. Johnathan—you bring **technical mastery, innovation, and precision**. Either one of you could take this position and make it stronger."*  

*A pause. The tension in the room thickens. Marcus turns to Shaw, who gives the slightest nod—silent permission to proceed.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"But there’s only one seat at the table."*  

*A beat. The decision is about to drop.*  

---

### **JOHNATHAN’S INTERNAL THOUGHTS:**  
- *Anticipate the announcement. Expect probabilities. If I get it, act with controlled humility. If I don’t, conceal disappointment. This is a game. Always a game.*  
- *Don’t look at Malcolm—he’s my competition but not my enemy.*  
- *What does Shaw think? He never reacts. Never reveals anything.*

# **FADE IN:**

## **INT. EDEN TECH HEADQUARTERS – EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM – NIGHT**  

*MARCUS LANCASTER stands firm at the head of the conference table, eyes moving between the two candidates. Silence hangs in the room, thick and weighty, before he finally speaks.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"The board has made its decision."*  

*The room tenses. Even those who are just observers hold their breath.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"Effective immediately, **Johnathan Reeves** is being promoted to **Assistant Head Manager of the Cybersecurity Division**."*  

*A beat. Then a polite but subdued round of applause. The decision is made.*  

*Johnathan, ever composed, absorbs the moment with a measured nod. He stands, offering his hand first—not to Marcus, but to Malcolm.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Hell of a race, huh?"*  

*Malcolm hesitates for only a second before gripping Johnathan’s hand. There’s a smile—genuine, but tight-lipped.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah. Real close."*  

*A silent acknowledgment passes between them. The congratulations are there, but so is the reality—**one of them won, and the other didn’t**.*  

*Gregory Shaw, still seated at the far end of the table, watches with **unreadable interest**. He offers nothing more than a single nod, a quiet recognition of the outcome, before rising and stepping out of the room with a deliberate, calculated pace.*

## **INT. EDEN TECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – NIGHT**  

*The Cybersecurity Division is an entirely different world from the executive floor—darker, sleek, and lined with high-tech workstations displaying live threat analyses and security protocols. A few employees glance up as **Johnathan and Malcolm step inside**, but the space remains professionally quiet.*  

*Johnathan walks toward his workstation—one he’s **spent years at**, one that now belongs to someone else. His new position means an **office of his own**, but before he can step into that future, he has to pack up the past.*  

*Malcolm lingers near his own desk but doesn’t sit. There’s a tension in the air—not hostile, but something left unsaid. Tessa Vargas, their sharp and perceptive colleague, leans against a desk nearby, arms crossed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"So, new boss. What’s the first order of business? Mandatory pizza parties?"*  

*Johnathan huffs a short laugh, shaking his head as he starts shutting down his system, reaching for his personal belongings—a **notebook, a few personal cables, an old USB drive** he barely remembers why he kept.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"First order of business? I’m heading home."*  

**TESSA**  
*"Wow. Power goes straight to your head, huh?"*  

*Malcolm, quiet up until now, exhales sharply and nods.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Well, enjoy the day off. Guess I’ll be seeing you around."*  

*He turns, heading toward his own desk, but something in his posture suggests this won’t be an easy shift. Johnathan watches for a moment before returning to his task.*  

*Packing up is quick. He’s never been one for clutter. The last thing he grabs is his **badge**—the one that **now holds more access than it did this morning**. He slides it into his pocket, slings his bag over his shoulder, and takes a last look around before stepping away from the desk he’s occupied for years.*  

*As he heads for the exit, Tessa calls after him.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Hey, don’t get too comfortable. The higher up you go, the easier it is to fall."*  

*Johnathan pauses, processing that. He doesn’t turn around, just smirks faintly before walking through the doors and into the city beyond.*
