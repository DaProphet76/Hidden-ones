# **FADE IN:**
## **Chapter 1: Scene 1**

## **EXT. JERUSALEM – HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – NIGHT**

*A **dusty wind** moves through the excavation site, the remnants of **Herod’s Temple** standing as a **monument of history and ruin.** The night air carries a faint scent of **earth and stone**, as if time itself lingers over the ruins. Beneath the harsh glare of **floodlights**, archaeologists, preservationists, and excavation engineers work meticulously, unearthing layers of **forgotten history** buried under centuries of debris.*

*A **temporary research tent** flaps in the wind, illuminated from within. Inside, **holographic projections and satellite imaging** overlay historical maps, reconstructing what once stood before the **Roman destruction of 70 CE.***  

---

## **INT. TEMPORARY FIELD HQ – NIGHT**

*Dr. **Marcus Strauss**, late 50s, sharp yet weary, stands over a **digital reconstruction of Herod’s Temple**. The holo-display flickers, showing **layers of the ancient structure**, each level containing the **secrets of an empire lost to war.***  

*Across from him, **Dr. Eva Mendez**, early 40s, intelligent, methodical, and **deeply invested in this discovery**, studies the **rotating 3D model** with keen interest.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(studying the model)*  
*"Standing here, beneath this ruin, you realize… Herod’s Temple was never truly sacred, was it?"*

*Strauss exhales, adjusting his glasses as the projection zooms in on the **inner court.** His voice is measured, but there’s something **distant** in his tone.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"It was a monument to power. Built not by a king of divine appointment, but by an **Edomite ruling in the place of Israelites**. A man whose bloodline was only permitted rule because of **forced conversion generations prior.**"*

*Mendez tilts her head slightly, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"John Hyrcanus. The Hasmonean ruler who forced the Edomites to accept Judaism?"*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(nodding)*  
*"Yes. After Judea expanded under his reign, the Edomites—**Herod’s ancestors**—were forcibly converted. But power doesn’t change lineage. Herod was **never truly accepted** by the people. His temple? It was **not built in reverence to the God of Israel, but to secure legitimacy** through grandeur."*

*Mendez crosses her arms, eyes narrowing slightly.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"A temple meant to cement his **political rule**, not for true worship. And yet, it still became the center of revolts."*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(exhaling deeply)*  
*"Because he ruled a people that would never fully accept him. That’s why he married into the **Hasmonean dynasty.** Mariamne I—the last true Israelite princess."*

*Mendez raises a brow, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"So he tried to **legitimize his rule** through marriage?"*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(grimly)*  
*"Yes. But when power is your only god, there can be no rivals. Herod **murdered Mariamne, killed his own children, and erased any bloodline** that could claim true Hasmonean heritage. Later, he **remarried into his own people**, ensuring his dynasty would be purely Edomite going forward."*

*Mendez shakes her head, watching the **holo-display shift** to the Roman siege of 70 CE.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(softly, thinking aloud)*  
*"So why do we still keep his traditions?"*

*Strauss exhales through his nose, leaning back against the table.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Because he was **raised among Israelites**, studied under their teachers, learned their ways. And when he seized power, he **ensured their customs remained**—even after his bloodline had been purged from their midst. The rituals, the priesthood, even aspects of religious governance today… all carry remnants of **Herod’s reign.**"*

*Mendez watches him carefully, sensing something unspoken beneath his words.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"And yet, we never discuss this in academia."*

*Strauss lets out a short, humorless chuckle.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(dryly)*  
*"No. Because if you speak of this, the **historical community will deny it, ostracize you, cut your career off.** These facts exist, but they are... inconvenient."*

*Mendez considers that, staring at the flickering holo-image of Herod’s Temple. The wind outside rattles the tent walls, as if the past itself refuses to stay buried.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(quietly, almost to himself)*  
*"Sigh... we have a lot to pay for if retribution is ever demanded and required of us."*  

*A long silence lingers. Then—*  

*A sharp **beep** from his radio interrupts the moment.*  

**FIELD ARCHAEOLOGIST (V.O.)** *(urgent, over radio)*  
*"Dr. Strauss, we’ve found something. You need to see this."*

*Mendez and Strauss exchange a glance before stepping outside.*  

---

## **EXT. HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – MAIN EXCAVATION AREA – NIGHT**

*A team of **archaeologists and preservationists** gathers around a **partially unearthed vault**, deep within the **foundation of Herod’s Temple**. The **ancient stone casing** has been **sealed for centuries**, its inscriptions **barely legible** beneath layers of dust and time.*  

*A nervous **field assistant** wipes sweat from his forehead as Strauss and Mendez arrive.*  

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"We were stabilizing the lower chamber when we uncovered this vault. It doesn’t match the Roman-era structures—it’s **older**."*

*Mendez crouches beside the stone lid, carefully brushing away **centuries of debris.** Her eyes narrow as she deciphers the faded engravings.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(reading)*  
*"High Priest... garments… preserved... holy relics?"*  

*Strauss watches as another **team member carefully pries the lid open.** The stone **groans in protest**, releasing a **stale gust of air**—the first breath this chamber has taken in **two thousand years.***  

---

## **INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – NIGHT**

*Inside the vault, **several artifacts lay preserved in the dust**—small fragments of history untouched by time. The team moves carefully, cataloging each discovery.*  

### **ITEMS FOUND IN THE VAULT:**
✔ **A golden goblet** – engraved with **priestly symbols**, possibly used in **rituals of purification.**  
✔ **A set of weighted scales** – small, but **perfectly balanced**, believed to have been used in **temple offerings.**  
✔ **A faded scroll fragment** – wrapped in deteriorating leather, the text too fragile to decipher.  
✔ **A tattered garment** – aged beyond recognition, but **fibers reveal it to be camel’s hair.**  

*Mendez holds up the **camel’s hair garment**, frowning.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"This… isn’t temple priest attire."*

*Strauss’ eyes drift to the **last artifact**—a **small, tarnished breastplate**, forgotten in the dust.*  

*Unlike the other artifacts, it isn’t **gold-plated or extravagant**. It looks… **simple. Ancient.** Overlooked.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(thoughtful, to himself)*  
*"And yet… it’s here."*

*Mendez glances at him, sensing the weight of the moment.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Should we mark it for high priority?"*  

*Strauss hesitates, then shakes his head.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"No. It’s not the primary find."*  

*Mendez nods, but something **lingers** in her gaze. This chamber held more than **forgotten relics.** It held a **forgotten truth.***

# **FADE IN**
# **Chapter 1: Scene 2** 

## **INT. UNKNOWN TEMPLE – DREAM SEQUENCE**

*A thick **shroud of darkness**. The faint flicker of torches barely pushes back the gloom.*

*A vast chamber—**ancient, forgotten**. The stone walls are lined with **faded inscriptions**, their meaning lost to time. The air is heavy with **something unspoken**, something pressing against the chest like a buried memory clawing its way to the surface.*

*Jonathan **watches from the shadows**, unseen but present. He doesn’t know where he is, yet **he feels like he’s been here before.***  

*At the center of the chamber, a group of **cloaked figures** stand in a **loose circle** around a raised altar. Their faces are hidden beneath deep hoods, their voices murmuring in a **language Jonathan doesn’t recognize… but somehow understands.***  

*A relic rests atop the altar—a **breastplate**, its surface **dull with age**, but faintly etched with **symbols that pulse in the dim firelight.***  

*One of the figures—**a leader**, more ornate than the rest—raises a hand. The murmuring ceases.*  

*A sharp **hiss of steel** echoes as **a ceremonial dagger is drawn.***  

*A shrouded figure kneels before the altar. Their head is bowed, their breathing ragged. The leader **lifts the blade.***  

*Jonathan’s heart pounds. He wants to move, to speak—but his body refuses. He is **trapped**, locked inside this moment.*  

*The dagger **slashes downward.***  

*Blood spills onto the breastplate, seeping into its engravings.*  

*A sudden **roar of sound—**an earthquake? A command? The chamber trembles.*  

*The hooded leader slowly turns their head…*  

*And **looks directly at Jonathan.***  

*A voice—**not from the figure, but inside Jonathan’s mind**—whispers in a tone that is both familiar and terrifying.*  

**UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)**  
*"You were there."*  

*Jonathan’s breath catches. The room tilts, distorting. The shadows **rush toward him**, swallowing everything—*

# **SMASH CUT TO:**

## **INT. DARK CHAMBER – DREAM SEQUENCE CONTINUES**

*Jonathan **jerks awake**—but he’s **still in the dream.***  

*The flickering torches remain, but now he is **no longer an observer.** He is **here.***  

*Iron chains bite into his wrists. His breathing is **sharp, uneven.** His heart pounds in his chest, but he can’t remember **why.***  

*He is **not alone.** Dozens of men stand in line beside him, **bound in shackles.** Their eyes are hollow, their faces streaked with sweat and dirt. Some whisper **prayers**; others are **silent, resigned to fate.***  

*A deep, cold voice **booms across the chamber.***  

**EXECUTIONER (O.S.)**  
*"Bring the next one."*  

*A **heavy door creaks open.** A guard yanks a prisoner from the line, dragging him forward. The man **struggles, pleading.** But it doesn’t matter.*  

*Jonathan watches, frozen, as the prisoner is forced down onto a massive **stone block**. His screams fill the air—*  

**SHHHHHRK!**  

*The executioner’s blade falls. Blood splatters onto the stone. The body **twitches once**—then goes still.*  

*Jonathan **gasps**, his body jerking instinctively. He **feels the warmth of the blood**, though it hasn’t touched him. It’s real. It’s all **too real.***  

*And then—*  

*The guard’s eyes **turn to him.***  

**GUARD**  
*"Next."*  

*The chains tighten. Jonathan is **yanked forward.** He fights, but it’s **futile.** The air is thick, suffocating. He can hear **the murmurs of the other prisoners**—some whisper his name. Others **bow their heads.***  

*A voice—**the same voice as before**—echoes in his mind, deep and unshakable.*  

**UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)**  
*"You know how this ends."*  

*Jonathan **grits his teeth**, thrashing against the guards, but their grip is **unbreakable.***  

*The stone block awaits. The executioner’s blade glistens, **still wet.***  

**EXECUTIONER**  
*"Kneel."*  

*Jonathan is **forced down**. His cheek **presses against the cold stone.** The executioner lifts the axe, **high above his head.***  

*Jonathan’s breath quickens. His vision **blurs.** This isn’t just a dream.*  

**This has happened before.**  

*A thought cuts through his fear, clear as thunder—*  

*"This is how John… died."*  

**SHHHHHRK!**  

---

# **SMASH CUT TO:**

## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**  

*Jonathan **jerks upright in bed—**GASPING, DRENCHED IN SWEAT. His breath comes in **ragged, panicked bursts.** The dim glow of a bedside lamp flickers on.*  

*Beside him, **Rebecca stirs, her hand reaching for him.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"Babe? Jonathan—hey, hey, it’s okay!"*  

*She **cups his face**, worry deep in her wide, **blue eyes.** Jonathan doesn’t answer—he’s **staring at his hands.** They **tremble.** He swears he can still feel the **chains.** The coldness of the stone. The final moment before the blade…*  

*He shudders. Swallows hard. Finally **meets her gaze.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"Was it the dream again?"*  

*Jonathan **runs a hand through his damp hair.** His **chest rises and falls, his heartbeat still erratic.** He finally nods, voice **hoarse.***  

**Jonathan**  
*"Yeah. Same one."*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Baby, that’s the third time this week."*  

*She moves closer, resting a **gentle hand on his arm.** Her concern is real—but Jonathan is barely listening. His **mind is still trapped** in that chamber, that moment.*  

*He forces a breath, leans forward, elbows on his knees.*  

**Jonathan**  
*"I’ve been having these dreams since I was a kid."*  

*He looks at her, **eyes shadowed.** There’s something deeper in his voice now—**a fear he won’t admit.** A truth he doesn’t want to say aloud.*  

**Jonathan**  
*"But this one… it’s getting worse."*  

*She hesitates. Then—softly, carefully—*  

**REBECCA**  
*"What if it means something?"*  

*Jonathan **stiffens.** His jaw tightens. He **shakes his head.***  

**Jonathan**  
*"It doesn’t."*  

*But even as he says it—**he knows he’s lying.***
