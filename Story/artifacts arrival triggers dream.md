# **FADE IN: Chapter X – Later Dream Sequence**  

## **INT. EDENTECH – SECURITY DIVISION – AFTERNOON**  

*A low hum of **server racks** fills the air. Screens flicker with **security feeds, encryption logs**, and **access control diagnostics.** The tension in the air is subtle but present—**a sense of something coming.**  

*Tessa **leans against Jonathan’s workstation**, scrolling through a **security manifest** on her tablet. Across the floor, Malcolm is **coordinating clearance protocols** with a few other analysts. The office feels **normal. Routine.** But Jonathan…*  

*Jonathan **feels different.** His hands hover over the keyboard, but the **screen in front of him blurs.** The distant **beeping of access terminals slows, stretching unnaturally.** The overhead lights **dim for a moment—then flicker, just once.***  

*A deep **pressure** grips his chest. Not fear. Not panic. Just… **pulling.** A sensation **beneath his skin**, behind his eyes. The world around him feels **thicker, heavier**, as if something unseen is pressing against reality itself.*  

*A **security alert flashes** on his screen—*  

### **"Artifact Transport Arriving: Secured Storage – Level 4"**  

*Jonathan blinks once.*  

*Then—**the world shifts.***

## **INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – DREAM SEQUENCE**  

*A **flash of torchlight. The heavy scent of damp stone and iron.** The **same chamber, but clearer now.** More **defined.** More **real.***  

*Jonathan is **not watching from the shadows this time.** He is **standing there**—**within the moment, within the memory.** He can feel the **coldness of the floor**, the faint **vibrations of footsteps overhead**, as if an entire **kingdom moves above, unaware of what happens below.**  

*The kneeling prisoner is in front of him again, but now—**Jonathan can see his face.**  

*It’s familiar. Too familiar.*  

*Dark, piercing eyes. A **strong jaw, hollowed slightly by exhaustion.** A man who has **been in chains for too long, but has not been broken.** A man who has accepted his fate, yet **refuses to submit to the moment itself.**  

*Jonathan's heartbeat **slows. Deepens. The air itself thickens.** He **remembers this.** The details, the emotions, the weight of it.**  

*He was here. He was here. He was—*  

*A **sharp voice cuts through the thick air.***  

**COMMANDER (O.S.)**  
*"Do it."*  

*A soldier **steps forward, blade in hand.** This time, Jonathan is **not frozen.** He **feels the cold air shift as the blade is lifted.** The firelight flickers against the **iron edge**, reflecting briefly in the prisoner's **dark eyes.**  

*A single moment stretches—*  

*A single thought pulses through Jonathan's mind—*  

*"This man… was innocent."*  

*Then—*  

**A loud, metallic clang.**

## **INT. EDENTECH – SECURITY DIVISION – AFTERNOON**  

*"Jonathan."*  

*Jonathan **blinks sharply.**  

*He is back. The **fluorescent office lights buzz above him.** The monitors hum softly. The normal world is **moving again.**  

*Tessa is **leaning closer**, her brow furrowed in **deep concern.** She has been **repeating his name**, her voice **low but firm.**  

**TESSA** *(softer now, studying him)*  
*"Jonathan…? You good?"*  

*Jonathan **exhales sharply**, his body still **rigid, locked in place.** His hands are **curled into fists against the desk.** His pulse **thunders in his ears.** He takes a slow, **controlled breath.**  

*Tessa doesn’t move away immediately. She watches him, her concern **genuine, unspoken.** This wasn’t just **zoning out.** She knows that much.*  

**TESSA** *(still cautious, but softer)*  
*"Where’d you just go?"*  

*Jonathan swallows. He **doesn’t have an answer.** He doesn’t even know **how to explain it.***  

*A moment passes. He finally shakes his head, forcing out a dry, quiet response.*  

**JONATHAN** *(clears his throat, low)*  
*"Nowhere. Just… thinking."*  

*Tessa doesn’t believe him. Not completely. But she doesn’t push. Instead, she **leans back slightly**, arms crossing over her chest.*  

**TESSA** *(light, but not dismissive)*  
*"Damn. Thinking that hard? Didn’t even hear me the first four times."*  

*Jonathan **forces a breath, exhales slowly.** He **relaxes his hands**, feeling the faint tremor still there. He **tries to focus on the monitors.** Normal things. Work things. But his mind is still… there. Still in the chamber. Still seeing that **face.**  

*Tessa lingers a beat longer, watching him. Her **eyes flicker with something—concern, care. But not pity.**  

*Then, finally—she **taps the edge of his desk with two fingers, a small, grounding gesture.***  

**TESSA** *(soft smirk, but her voice is real this time)*  
*"Don’t think too hard, John. Might start scaring me."*  

*She **walks off, but she doesn’t look convinced.***  

*Jonathan watches her go, his pulse **still uneven.** The office **moves as normal again.** The world **continues.** But inside him, something is **wrong.**  

*Something is waking up.**  

**FADE TO BLACK.**
