# **FADE IN:**
## **Chapter 1: Scene 1**

## EXT. JERUSALEM – HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – NIGHT  

*A **dusty wind** moves through the excavation site, the remnants of **Herod’s Temple** standing as a **monument of history and ruin**. The night air carries a faint scent of **earth and stone**, as if time itself lingers over the ruins. Beneath the harsh glare of **floodlights**, archaeologists, preservationists, and excavation engineers work meticulously, unearthing layers of **forgotten history** buried under centuries of debris.*  

*A **temporary research tent** flaps in the wind, illuminated from within. Inside, **holographic projections and satellite imaging** overlay historical maps, reconstructing what once stood before the **Roman destruction of 70 CE.** The excavation hums with quiet intensity—the feeling of a long-buried secret being pried from the earth.*  

---

## INT. TEMPORARY FIELD HQ – NIGHT  

*Dr. **Marcus Strauss**, late 50s, sharp yet weary, stands over a **digital reconstruction of Herod’s Temple**. The holo-display flickers, showing **layers of the ancient structure**, each level containing the **secrets of an empire lost to war.** He is deep in thought, his eyes scanning the projections like a man searching for something already lost.*  

*Across from him, **Dr. Eva Mendez**, early 40s, intelligent, methodical, and **deeply invested in this discovery**, studies the **rotating 3D model** with keen interest. A soft frown tugs at her lips as she focuses on the blueprint of the **inner sanctum**.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(studying the model)*  
*"Standing here, beneath this ruin, you realize… Herod’s Temple was never truly sacred, was it?"*  

*Strauss exhales, adjusting his glasses as the projection zooms in on the **inner court.** His voice is measured, but there’s something **distant** in his tone.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(quietly)*  
*"It was a monument to power. Built not by a king of divine appointment, but by an **Edomite ruling in the place of Israelites.** A man whose bloodline was only permitted rule because of **forced conversion generations prior.**"*  

*Mendez tilts her head slightly, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"John Hyrcanus. The Hasmonean ruler who forced the Edomites to accept Judaism?"*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(nodding)*  
*"Yes. After Judea expanded under his reign, the Edomites  —**Herod’s ancestors**— were forcibly converted. But power doesn’t change lineage. Herod was **never truly accepted** by the people. His temple? It was **not built in reverence to the God of Israel, but to secure legitimacy** through grandeur."*  

*Mendez crosses her arms, her expression pensive.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"A temple meant to cement his **political rule**, not for true worship. And yet, it still became the center of revolts."*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(grimly)*  
*"Because he ruled a people that would never fully accept him. That’s why he married into the **Hasmonean dynasty.** Mariamne I—the last true Israelite princess."*  

*Mendez raises a brow, intrigued.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"So he tried to **legitimize his rule** through marriage?"*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(exhaling deeply)*  
*"Yes. But when power is your only god, there can be no rivals. Herod **murdered Mariamne I, killed his own children, and erased any bloodline** that could claim true Hasmonean heritage. Later, he **remarried into his own people**, ensuring his dynasty would be purely Edomite going forward."*  

*Mendez shakes her head, watching the **holo-display shift** to the Roman siege of 70 CE.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(softly, thinking aloud)*  
*"So why do we still keep his traditions?"*  

*Strauss exhales through his nose, leaning back against the table.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(quietly, almost to himself)*  
*"Because he was **raised among Israelites**, studied under their teachers, learned their ways. And when he seized power, he **ensured their customs remained**—even after his bloodline had been purged from their midst. The rituals, the priesthood, even aspects of religious governance today… all carry remnants of **Herod’s reign and his attempt to establish himself and his people as the legitimate Jews. Even to this very day.**"*  

*Mendez watches him carefully, sensing something unspoken beneath his words.*  

*A sharp **beep** from his radio interrupts the moment.*  

**FIELD ARCHAEOLOGIST (V.O.)** *(urgent, over radio)*  
*"Dr. Strauss, we’ve found something. You need to see this."*  

*Mendez and Strauss exchange a glance before stepping outside.*  

---

## EXT. HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – MAIN EXCAVATION AREA – NIGHT  

*A team of **archaeologists and preservationists** gathers around a **partially unearthed vault**, deep within the **foundation of Herod’s Temple**. The **ancient stone casing** has been **sealed for centuries**, its inscriptions **barely legible** beneath layers of dust and time.*  

*A nervous **field assistant** wipes sweat from his forehead as Strauss and Mendez arrive.*  

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"We were stabilizing the lower chamber when we uncovered this vault. It doesn’t match the Roman-era structures—it’s **older**."*  

*Mendez crouches beside the stone lid, carefully brushing away **centuries of debris.** Her eyes narrow as she deciphers the faded engravings.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(reading)*  
*"High Priest... garments… preserved... holy relics?"*  

*Strauss watches as another **team member carefully pries the lid open.** The stone **groans in protest**, releasing a **stale gust of air**—the first breath this chamber has taken in **two thousand years.***  

---

## INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – NIGHT  

*Inside the vault, **several artifacts lay preserved in the dust**—small fragments of history untouched by time. The team moves carefully, cataloging each discovery.*  

### **ITEMS FOUND IN THE VAULT:**  
✔ **A golden goblet** – engraved with **priestly symbols**, possibly used in **rituals of purification.**  
✔ **A set of weighted scales** – small, but **perfectly balanced**, believed to have been used in **temple offerings.**  
✔ **A faded scroll fragment** – wrapped in deteriorating leather, the text too fragile to decipher.  
✔ **A folded set of garments** – heavily deteriorated, the fabric nearly indistinguishable under layers of dust and decay.  

*Mendez lifts the **decayed garment**, holding it carefully.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Strange… The condition is poor, but this doesn’t look ceremonial."*  

*Strauss barely acknowledges it. His gaze is locked onto the final artifact, **half-buried in the dust**—a **small, tarnished breastplate**, seemingly overlooked among the more ornate relics.*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(thoughtful, to himself)*  
*"And yet… it’s here."*  

*Mendez glances at him, sensing the weight of the moment.*  

*The wind outside howls, rattling the vault walls. The air feels heavier than before.*  

# FADE TO BLACK.

# **FADE IN**
## **Chapter 1: Scene 2** 

## **INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – DREAM SEQUENCE**  

*A suffocating darkness. The air is **damp, stale**, thick with the scent of **stone, sweat, and something deeper—something metallic.**  

*Jonathan **stands in the shadows**, heart pounding in his ears. He doesn’t know **where he is**—but his body does. His **skin prickles**, his chest **tightens** with a terror that hasn’t fully surfaced yet.*  

*A faint **torchlight flickers** against the walls, revealing **crude stone architecture**, **carved pillars**, and a **low ceiling that presses downward**. There are **no windows. No exits in sight.** Just the **weight of the earth above.***  

*Then—**the sound of chains.** A rusted **iron gate creaks open**.*  

*A group of **soldiers in armor** enters, their **faces hidden beneath shadowed helmets**. Their movements are methodical, cold. Behind them, a man is **dragged forward**, his **wrists bound by iron shackles.** His clothes are **ragged, stained with dirt and dried blood.** His **hair clings to his damp forehead**, but his back remains **straight.** He does not resist. He does not plead. He kneels before a **raised stone platform**, head lowered.*  

*A **single figure steps forward**—a man of **power**, dressed in a **dark robe** that pools at his feet. His presence is heavy, commanding, but his **face remains obscured** by the dim torchlight.*  

**COMMANDER (O.S.)**  
*"This is the will of the one above us."*  

*Jonathan **tries to move, to call out**, but his **body does not respond.** His breath is shallow, his pulse **slamming against his ribs**. He **knows this place. He knows this moment.** But why?*  

*A nearby **stone table glistens**—not with water, but with **old stains.** Used before. Used many times.*  

*The kneeling man **does not tremble**. His head tilts up slightly, and Jonathan catches a glimpse of his **eyes**—calm, resigned, unwavering.*  

*A soft, **familiar voice** brushes against Jonathan’s mind. Not from the man. Not from the soldiers. Not from the commander.*  

**UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)**  
*"You were there."*  

*Jonathan’s breath **catches.** The **room tilts, warps**, the walls **closing in, pressing against him**—*  

*A soldier **steps forward**, unsheathing a **broad, heavy blade.** The metal **sings** as it slices through the thick, stagnant air.*  

*Jonathan’s mind **screams, but no sound comes out.** He is frozen, locked inside a **memory that isn’t just a memory.***  

*The blade is lifted high—*  

**SMASH CUT TO:**  

---

## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**  

*Jonathan **jerks upright, gasping.** His lungs **struggle for air**, his body **rigid with tension**. The sheets are **damp with sweat**, sticking to his skin. His **hands tremble** against his legs.*  

*The room is **silent. Too silent.***  

*A soft movement beside him—Rebecca stirs, her voice heavy with sleep.*  

**REBECCA** *(groggy, concerned)*  
*"Jonathan…?"*  

*She reaches for him, fingers grazing his arm, but he barely reacts. His eyes are **wide, unfocused.** He’s still **there**—still in the chamber, the smell of stone and iron **lingering in his mind.***  

*Rebecca sits up slightly, frowning.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Hey, look at me — breathe."*  

*Jonathan **inhales sharply**, forcing himself back into the present. He turns, meeting her gaze, but he can tell—**she sees it. The fear. The confusion.** The fact that he is **shaken in a way he can’t explain.***  

**REBECCA** *(softer now)*  
*"The dream again?"*  

*Jonathan swallows hard, nods once. His voice is **low, hoarse** when he speaks.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Yeah… but this one was—*"  

*He stops himself. His throat tightens. He doesn’t know how to finish that sentence.*  

**Rebecca studies him, then exhales.** She’s seen this before. Too many times.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"That’s the third time this week."*  

*Jonathan runs a hand over his face, trying to shake the feeling. His mind still **echoes with the whisper**.*  

*"You were there."*  

*He looks at her now, his **expression unreadable**, but his **eyes hold something deeper**—something **unspoken.***  

**JONATHAN** *(quietly)*  
*"It felt… real."*  

*A beat. Rebecca hesitates, before finally speaking, voice soft, careful.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"What if it means something?"*  

*Jonathan’s **jaw tightens.** His hands **clench into fists.** The instinct is immediate, almost **violent.** He shakes his head, firm, dismissive.*  

**JONATHAN** *(low, almost to himself)*  
*"It doesn’t."*  

*But even as he says it—**he knows he’s lying.***  

**FADE TO BLACK.**  



# **FADE IN**
## **Chapter 1: Scene 3**


## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**

*The soft hum of the city outside. The bedside lamp **casts a warm glow**, flickering slightly as **Rebecca** watches Jonathan, concern still etched on her face.*

**REBECCA**  
*"You sure you're okay?"*  

*Jonathan exhales slowly, rubbing his face with both hands. His body still **feels the weight** of the dream—**the chains, the cold stone, the final moment.** But he nods anyway.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Yeah… yeah, I’m good."*  

*She **doesn’t believe him,** but she also knows pushing won’t get her anywhere. Instead, she **brushes a hand over his arm, squeezing gently.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"Come back to bed."*  

*He hesitates, eyes lingering on the **dimly lit clock**—**4:37 AM.** Then, finally, he sighs and **slides back under the covers.** Rebecca turns off the lamp, settling against him.*  

*As his eyes close, he whispers—almost to himself—*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"It felt real."*  

*Rebecca, half-asleep now, murmurs back—*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Dreams always do."*  

*But deep down, Jonathan **knows better.***  

---

## **INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT – MORNING**

*A **sharp alarm buzzes.** The city is alive now—**cars honking, distant voices, the sizzle of bacon in a nearby apartment.** Rebecca moves around the kitchen, pouring coffee, while Jonathan finishes tying his **black techwear boots.***  

*She slides his mug toward him as he steps up to the counter, **grabbing a quick sip.** His face is still groggy, but he’s forcing himself into **work mode.** Rebecca eyes him over her own coffee.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Better sleep?"*  

**JONATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Barely."*  

*He checks his phone, scrolling through **corporate emails and security alerts.** His brow furrows slightly—one **unread message** catches his attention.*  

**SUBJECT:**  
**ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTAKE & SECURITY PROTOCOLS – CONFIDENTIAL**  
**Access Level:** [RESTRICTED]  

*Jonathan clicks it, but before the details load—*  

**ACCESS DENIED. INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE.**  

*He blinks, staring at the **red warning screen.** Rebecca notices his expression shift.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"What’s wrong?"*  

*Jonathan shakes his head, shutting off his phone.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Nothing. Just work stuff."*  

*Before she can press further, **a car horn blares from outside.** Jonathan checks the time—**Malcolm’s here.** He downs the rest of his coffee, grabs his **EdenTech badge,** and heads for the door. Rebecca follows.*  

---

## **EXT. BROOKLYN STREET – MORNING**

*A sleek **black sedan** idles at the curb. **Malcolm Grant**, always **calm under pressure**, leans against the driver’s side, scrolling through his phone. He looks up as **Jonathan and Rebecca step outside.***  

**MALCOLM** *(grinning)*  
*"You look like hell, man."*  

*Rebecca **side-eyes Malcolm** as she walks toward her own car.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Make sure he actually stays awake at work."*  

*MALCOLM smirks, **tipping an imaginary hat.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yes, ma’am. Keeping him in check is my full-time job."*  

*Rebecca shakes her head with a **knowing smile** before getting into her car. Jonathan opens the **passenger door** and climbs in.*  

---

## **INT. MALCOLM’S CAR – DRIVING – MORNING**

*The city rushes past as Malcolm **navigates the morning traffic.** A faint **hip-hop instrumental** plays low in the background. Jonathan leans back, still trying to shake off the **lingering unease** from the dream.*  

*MALCOLM glances over.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You good? You actually look worse than usual."*  

**JONATHAN** *(scoffs, shaking his head)*  
*"Didn’t sleep much."*  

*MALCOLM doesn’t push it. Instead, he shifts gears—both literally and figuratively.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yo, so you hear the buzz? The **promotion spot** is officially open."*  

*That gets Jonathan’s attention. He **glances over**, expression neutral.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"You putting in for it?"*  

*MALCOLM smirks but doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, he takes a turn, fingers **tapping the steering wheel.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"I mean… I should be a **top choice.** But you know how these corporate types are."*  

*Jonathan huffs a **short laugh, shaking his head.***  

**JONATHAN**  
*"You saying it’s rigged?"*  

**MALCOLM** *(shrugging)*  
*"I’m saying... **who they pick and why** ain't always about skill."*  

*Jonathan leans his head against the **window**, watching the city blur past. He **knows Malcolm's right.** He also knows **he could gun for it himself.** But something in him hesitates.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"What about you? You throwing in?"*  

*A pause. Jonathan exhales, rubbing his jaw before finally answering—*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Haven’t decided."*  

*MALCOLM gives him a **knowing look** but lets it go. Instead, he **switches topics.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You hear about the **new project**?"*  

**JONATHAN** *(glancing over)*  
*"The archaeology thing?"*  

**MALCOLM** *(nodding)*  
*"Yeah. Word is, **EdenTech’s bringing in artifacts** from a major excavation overseas. Higher-ups been *real* hush-hush about it, but IT’s already on **security lockdown mode.** Whatever it is, it’s big."*  

*Jonathan’s **brows furrow slightly.** The word **artifacts** stirs something... **uneasy.** He shifts in his seat.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"You know what they found?"*  

*MALCOLM shakes his head, gripping the wheel a little tighter.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Not yet. But **Shaw’s running point.**"*  

*A **brief silence** follows. They both know—**if Gregory Shaw is involved, it’s more than just old bones.***  

*The car slows as they **approach EdenTech headquarters**, the **massive glass skyscraper** reflecting the morning sun. Malcolm pulls into the underground parking lot, killing the engine.*  

*MALCOLM leans back, throwing a smirk at Jonathan.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So… **promotion or not?**"*  

*Jonathan unbuckles, **smirking faintly but keeping his answer to himself.** He pushes the door open and steps out.*

# **Chapter 1: Scene 4**

## **EXT. EDENTECH HEADQUARTERS – ROOFTOP – EARLY MORNING**

*A **deep mechanical hum** grows in intensity as **twin helicopters** slice through the sky, their **rotors beating like war drums** against the city’s early morning silence. The **EdenTech skyscraper**, a sleek **monolith of glass and steel**, stands tall against the skyline. Its rooftop—a **designated high-security landing zone**—awaits the arrival of the **classified cargo.***  

*On the **reinforced helipad**, a **security team in black tactical gear** stands ready. Their movements are precise, methodical—**biometric scanners, weapons checks, radio confirmations.** Everything is controlled, everything is deliberate. They are **not standard corporate security**—this is **military-grade protocol.***  

*The **first helicopter descends**, its skids touching down with practiced ease. The **EdenTech insignia** gleams under the harsh floodlights as the rotor blades slowly wind down. A moment later, the **cargo bay doors slide open.***  

*A **team of armored personnel steps out first**, scanning the perimeter before **motioning for the handlers to proceed**. From within the cargo hold, a series of **reinforced black cases** are carefully moved onto **floating gurneys**, each one **marked with encrypted classification codes**. One case, in particular, **seems to demand extra attention**—its casing is **older, reinforced**, as if **it had been sealed long before EdenTech ever laid hands on it.***  

*A **second helicopter arrives**, repeating the **same calculated movements.** The air **smells of jet fuel and adrenaline.** No one speaks unnecessarily. Every action is **measured, every movement intentional.***  

*A **corporate logistics officer steps forward, verifying the manifest.** His voice is clipped, professional.*  

**LOGISTICS OFFICER**  
*"Transfer authorization confirmed. Moving artifacts to primary containment."*  

*A series of **metallic locks disengage** as the convoy begins its careful march toward the **building’s private elevator shaft.** From here, the **artifacts will be taken to their secured holding zones**—out of sight from the rest of the company, **sealed in a vault known only to the highest-clearance personnel.***  

*As the last artifact container is removed, one of the security officers **casts a lingering glance at the heavily reinforced case.** Something about it **unsettles him**, but he says nothing.*  

*The team moves inside. The rooftop is silent once more.*  

---

## **INT. EDENTECH HEADQUARTERS – MAIN LOBBY – MORNING**

*A **futuristic corporate tower**, sleek and modern, its **glass façade reflecting the city skyline**. Inside, the lobby is a blend of **advanced security checkpoints, biometric scanners, and digital displays cycling through corporate achievements.** Employees in **tailored business attire** and **high-tech ID badges** move with purpose.*  

*Jonathan and Malcolm step through the rotating glass doors. A **holographic interface** scans their badges as they pass security.*  

**SECURITY AI (V.O.)**  
*"Welcome, Jonathan Reeves. Welcome, Malcolm Grant."*  

*MALCOLM smirks, adjusting his blazer.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Gotta love a job that knows your name before you even say it."*  

**JONATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Yeah. Real personal touch."*  

*As they walk toward the elevators, a few **colleagues glance their way**, exchanging nods. **Everyone knows about the open promotion.** The air is charged with **silent competition.***  

**MALCOLM** *(leaning in, voice low)*  
*"They’re watching. All of them."*  

**JONATHAN** *(smirks)*  
*"Let them."*  

*MALCOLM chuckles, shaking his head as they step into the **elevator**. The doors slide shut, and the soft hum of ascent fills the silence.*  

---

## **INT. EDENTECH – EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM – MORNING**

*A **sleek, high-tech boardroom** with **a panoramic view of the city.** The room is dimly lit except for the glow of an **interactive holo-table** in the center. A **3D projection of an excavation site** flickers above it—**ancient ruins, stone walls, tunnels leading into darkness.***  

*Sitting at the head of the table, **GREGORY SHAW**—CEO of EdenTech. His expression is unreadable, his **hands folded calmly** as he watches the others take their seats. Around him, a mix of **executives, cybersecurity leads, and key researchers** from the archaeology team sit in anticipation.*  

*Jonathan, Malcolm, and Tessa settle into their seats near the **security team section.** The tension in the room is palpable.*  

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**  
*"We appreciate you all making time this morning. Let’s get straight to it."*  

*He gestures toward **DR. MARCUS STRAUSS**, a lead **archaeologist** in his late 50s, dressed in **practical fieldwear** despite the corporate setting. Strauss clears his throat, tapping at the **holo-table**. The **3D projection zooms in** on a specific section of the ruins.*

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"EdenTech has secured exclusive research access to an **archaeological zone near the remnants of King Herod’s temple wall.** After extensive negotiations with Israeli authorities, we’ve been granted **the first corporate-backed excavation rights** in this sector."*  

*Tessa **raises a brow, exchanging a look with Jonathan.** Corporate-backed? That’s rare.*  

*MALCOLM smirks slightly, whispering under his breath—*  

**MALCOLM** *(low voice)*  
*"Sounds expensive."*  

**GREGORY SHAW** *(calmly, without looking up)*  
*"It was."*  

*A silence settles before **Strauss continues.***  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Our team has uncovered **several artifacts** that will be transferred here for **analysis and preservation.** Your division will oversee the **cybersecurity and logistical protocols** for securing these artifacts during their transport and housing in EdenTech’s private archive."*  

*Tessa leans back slightly, arms crossed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"And what exactly are we guarding?"*  

---

## **ON SCREEN – LISTED ARTIFACTS FOR TRANSPORT**  

- **Ancient bronze relics** with unknown engravings  
- **Damaged scroll fragments** encased in protective resin  
- **Gold-plated ceremonial object** (partially restored)  
- **A piece of an ornamental breastplate** (unidentified origin)  

---

**MALCOLM** *(frowning slightly)*  
*"That last one seems… oddly specific."*  

**DR. STRAUSS** *(ignoring the comment, moving on)*  
*"Each item will undergo a **multi-stage authentication process** to determine historical significance and proper handling. Until further notice, these artifacts will remain **off-record to external entities.**"*  

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**  
*"Now, as for your responsibilities—"*  

*He nods toward the **head of the cybersecurity division**, MARCUS LANCASTER, who takes over.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"Jonathan. Malcolm. Tessa. Your team will be leading the **internal security integration** for this project. That means—**surveillance, access logs, breach detection.** No one outside this room is to have clearance."*  

*A pause. Shaw observes the **entire team**—his gaze sharp, assessing. Not just Jonathan, but **all of them**.*  

*MALCOLM, ever the skeptic, exhales sharply.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So what aren’t we being told?"*  

*A flicker of something—**amusement? Calculation?**—crosses Shaw’s face before he responds.*  

**GREGORY SHAW**  
*"Nothing you need to concern yourselves with at this stage."*  

*MALCOLM holds his stare for a moment before **leaning back in his chair**, nodding slowly. The tension **lingers.***

*Jonathan stares at the last item, something about it **nagging at his subconscious.** The vague description bothers him.*  

**Jonathan** *(quietly, to himself)*  
*"Ornamental breastplate?"*

*MALCOLM, skimming the list, frowns slightly.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"That last one seems… oddly specific."*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(ignoring the comment, moving on)*  
*"Each item will undergo a **multi-stage authentication process** to determine historical significance and proper handling. Until further notice, these artifacts will remain **off-record to external entities.**"*

*Jonathan glances at Shaw, who **hasn’t spoken much.** But his gaze is sharp, watchful. Like he’s **measuring everyone’s reactions.***  

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**
*"Now, as for your responsibilities—"*

*He nods toward the **head of the cybersecurity division**, MARCUS LANCASTER, who takes over.*

*MARCUS, a **seasoned veteran in security management**, speaks with precision.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"Jonathan. Malcolm. Tessa. Your team will be leading the **internal security integration** for this project. That means—**surveillance, access logs, breach detection.** No one outside this room is to have clearance."*

*Jonathan and Malcolm exchange a look. **This just got serious.***  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"We’ll be implementing **classified protocols** for digital containment. That includes **restricted server access, biometric entry for physical storage zones, and live threat analysis.**"*

**TESSA** *(leaning forward)*  
*"So we’re treating this like **a national security asset**?"*

**GREGORY SHAW** *(calmly)*  
*"That would be an accurate comparison."*

*Another beat of **silence.** Something about Shaw’s **tone** makes the entire room feel colder. Jonathan **studies him carefully.***  

*MALCOLM, ever the skeptic, exhales sharply.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So what aren’t we being told?"*

*Shaw finally looks up, his gaze locking onto Malcolm’s with a faint, unreadable smirk.*  

**GREGORY SHAW**  
*"Nothing you need to concern yourself with at this stage."*

*MALCOLM holds his stare for a moment before **leaning back in his chair**, nodding slowly.*  

*Tessa **glances at Jonathan**, seeing the way he’s still looking at the **artifact list on the screen.** He seems... **drawn to it.***  

---

## **INTERCOM (V.O.)**  
*"Security transport for Project Athena will commence in **48 hours.** All lead personnel prepare protocols accordingly."*

*MARCUS nods, closing the **briefing session.***  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"That’s all for now. Get to work."*

*Chairs slide back. Executives file out. Strauss murmurs something to a fellow researcher. Shaw stands, straightens his **tailored suit**, and exits without another word.*  

---

## INT. EDENTECH – HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER  

*Tessa, Malcolm, and Jonathan **walk back toward their division**, the weight of the meeting **lingering.***

*MALCOLM scoffs, running a hand over his jaw.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You’re telling me we’re locking down **ancient artifacts** like they’re **nuclear launch codes**? Something’s off."*

**TESSA** *(glancing at Jonathan)*  
*"You’ve been quiet."*

*Jonathan stops mid-step, still processing. Something about **that ornamental breastplate.** His gut tells him **this isn’t just a relic.***

**Jonathan** *(finally speaking, voice low)*  
*"I think this is bigger than we realize."*

*MALCOLM gives him a look, smirking slightly.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah? You gonna start believing in **ancient curses and lost treasures** now?"*

*Jonathan doesn’t answer. He just **keeps walking.** The image of the **breastplate** still lingers in his mind… **as if he’s seen it before.***

## **INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – AFTERNOON**

*A low hum of **server racks** fills the air. Rows of **high-tech workstations** glow under dimmed blue lights, each screen flashing with **coding interfaces, network monitoring tools, and security protocols in progress.** Large **interactive displays** map out access routes and encryption layers for the upcoming **artifact transfer.***  

*Jonathan, Tessa, and Malcolm stand near the **central operations hub**, reviewing the **latest system configurations** while their team of **engineers and analysts** works around them.*  

*Tessa taps a few keys on a **touchscreen panel, scanning the system logs.***  

**TESSA**  
*"Alright, so we’re running a **segmented security model**—only **biometric clearance and direct ID authentication** can access the archives. Even **Shaw himself** has to log in with dual verification."*  

*MALCOLM, arms crossed, nods while glancing at the **encryption firewall logs.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Fine. But what about external threats? If someone tries **breaching from an outside network**, we need an **instant kill switch** before data gets compromised."*  

*Jonathan, typing rapidly on his console, speaks without looking up.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"I’m implementing a **multi-tiered fail-safe**. If an unauthorized entity tries to force their way in, the **server partitions itself**, isolating the breach before wiping volatile data."*  

*Tessa whistles, clearly impressed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Damn. You trying to build a digital Fort Knox?"*  

**JONATHAN** *(smirking, still typing)*  
*"If I do my job right, even **we** won’t be able to break in without clearance."*  

*MALCOLM, skeptical, leans over to check Jonathan’s screen.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah? What about **internal threats**?"*  

*Tessa leans back in her chair, arms behind her head.*  

**TESSA**  
*"See, that’s the real issue. We can guard **against the world**, but if someone **inside EdenTech** decides to play dirty? That’s a whole different problem."*  

*MALCOLM nods, rubbing his chin.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Exactly. And we both know **this company’s got secrets.** Hell, we’re getting locked out of half the damn logs."*  

*Jonathan doesn’t respond immediately. He knows Malcolm is right. This isn’t **just a security job**—there’s a level of **secrecy** even they aren’t being told. But instead of voicing his concern, he refocuses on his screen.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Then we build a system that makes internal leaks **traceable**. If someone **inside** tries to bypass security, we **track them in real time.**"*  

*Tessa raises a brow, intrigued.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Oh? You thinking **counter-surveillance?**"*  

*MALCOLM chuckles, shaking his head.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"My man’s out here setting traps before we even catch a rat."*  

*Jonathan smirks but keeps his focus on the monitor.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Better safe than sorry."*

*Tessa claps her hands together, pushing away from her workstation.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Alright, well… this is officially the **most secure system we’ve ever built.** Unless someone’s got magic, we should be good."*  

*MALCOLM stretches, rolling his shoulders.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Magic? Man, you been watching too many movies."*  

*Tessa smirks, standing up.*  

**TESSA**  
*"And you don’t watch enough."*  

*MALCOLM shakes his head as **the clock on the wall flashes 6:45 PM.** The workday is wrapping up. Engineers are **logging off, stretching, grabbing their stuff.** The security protocols are in place, and now, it’s just a matter of **waiting for the artifacts to arrive.***  

**MALCOLM** *(grabbing his bag)*  
*"Alright, I’m out. I got a gym session, then I’m hitting the bar. You in?"*  

*Jonathan shakes his head, shutting down his station.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"Nah, I’m heading home."*  

*Tessa shrugs.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Suit yourself, bossman. Try not to dream about **firewalls and intrusion logs** tonight."*  

*Jonathan smirks, slinging his bag over his shoulder.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"No promises."*  

---

## **INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – LATE NIGHT**  

*A dim glow from **monitors and security feeds** illuminates the otherwise empty office. The floor is nearly deserted—most employees have left for the night. **Tessa Vargas**, still at her workstation, leans back in her chair, chewing on a pen cap as she scrolls through layers of **encrypted files** on her **holo-screen**.*  

*The **system hums softly**, displaying endless lines of **authorization logs and classified data archives**. Every few seconds, **Tessa glances over her shoulder**, half-expecting someone to walk in. The files she’s looking through… **she shouldn’t be looking at.***  

*Her fingers dance over the keys, **bypassing basic firewalls**, slipping past **security alerts** like a ghost. She mutters to herself—*  

### **TESSA** *(low voice)*  
*"Alright, let’s see what these corporate creeps don’t want us knowing."*  

*The **screen flickers**, the **EdenTech security database** adjusting to her **clearance bypass**. She exhales slowly—her heart pounds. She’s done **covert digging before**, but this is different.*  

*Finally, a **project archive** pops up—**old, buried records**, hidden under **obsolete classification codes**.*  

---

## **ON SCREEN:**  
### **PROJECT: ATHENA – HISTORICAL ACQUISITIONS**  
**Date:** March 2017  
**Status:** Terminated  
**Lead Investigator:** Gregory Shaw  
**Description:** Recovery & Containment of High-Risk Artifacts  
**Security Level:** Black Class Authorization  

---

*Tessa squints. **Black Class Authorization?** That’s the **highest clearance level in the company**. Even **department heads don’t get access** to those files.*  

*Her cursor hovers over the **"Open Detailed Report"** button. She hesitates.*  

*"Screw it."*  

*She clicks.*  

*Instantly, the screen **blurs with a red security warning**—*  

---

## **WARNING: ACCESS RESTRICTED. ADMINISTRATIVE OVERRIDE REQUIRED.**  
## **ATTEMPT LOGGED.**  
## **REPORTING TO SECURITY MAINFRAME.**  
## **DISCONNECTING IN 10 SECONDS.**  

---

### **TESSA** *(muttering)*  
*"Shit."*  

*She **yanks her connection line**, **killing the system feed** just before the security lockout activates. The screen **fades to black**, and for a second, there’s **nothing but silence**.*  

*Then, her **workstation reboots itself.** Like nothing ever happened.*  

*But she knows better.*  

*Tessa leans back, rubbing her face. Her mind races—what the hell did she just **almost see**?*  

*Her eyes flick toward the **security logs** she copied just before the system locked her out.*  

*And then—*  

*A faint **reflection appears on her screen**—not her own.*  

*For a split second, a **shadowy figure** stands behind her.*  

*She **whips around—nothing.** The office is empty.*  

*Tessa exhales, shivering. Whatever she just triggered… **someone knows.***

# **Chapter 1: Scene 7**
# **FADE IN**

## **INT. JONATHAN & REBECCA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

*A **soft glow from the kitchen light** spills into the darkened apartment. The faint hum of the **city outside** filters through the windows—car horns, distant sirens, the rhythmic pulse of life beyond these walls.*

*Jonathan unlocks the door, stepping inside. The scent of **roasted vegetables and seared meat** lingers in the air. Rebecca, dressed in **casual homewear**, stands by the stove, plating the last portion of dinner.*

*She glances up as he enters, offering a small smile.*

**REBECCA**  
*"Didn’t think I’d see you before midnight."*

*Jonathan **smirks faintly**, dropping his bag by the couch. His movements are **slower than usual, weighted**, as if something unseen presses on his shoulders. He rubs a hand over his face before stepping toward the counter.*

**JONATHAN**  
*"Long day?"*

**REBECCA** *(nodding, stretching her neck)*  
*"Draining. Too many emails, too many meetings. Same cycle, different day."*

*Jonathan exhales, rolling his shoulders as he takes a seat at the counter. Rebecca slides a plate toward him, watching him **closely**. His expression is distant, his focus absent. He chews absently, **his mind clearly elsewhere.***

**REBECCA** *(softly, studying him)*  
*"You didn’t hear a word I just said, did you?"*

*Jonathan looks up, blinking as if pulling himself out of a fog. He forces a half-smile.*

**JONATHAN**  
*"No, I—sorry. Just… a lot on my mind."*

**REBECCA** *(leaning forward slightly, prodding)*  
*"Work?"*

*Jonathan hesitates. He wants to say yes. That would be the easy answer. But **something in him resists lying to her.***

**JONATHAN** *(quietly)*  
*"It’s this new project. Feels… off."*

*Rebecca tilts her head slightly.*

**REBECCA**  
*"Off how?"*

*Jonathan hesitates again, gripping his fork tighter. The **artifact list, the secrecy, the unease**—it all sits in his chest like a lead weight. He exhales, shaking his head.*

**JONATHAN**  
*"Just different."*

*Rebecca watches him for a beat, then sets her fork down with a soft clink. She doesn’t press further, but her voice lowers, more grounded.*

**REBECCA**  
*"I don’t know what’s happening in that head of yours, but you’re starting to feel like a ghost in this house, Jon."*

*Jonathan’s jaw tightens. He **wants to say something—anything—but words fail him.** Instead, he nods, offering a half-hearted smile.*

**JONATHAN** *(softly)*  
*"I hear you."*

*A comfortable silence settles as they eat. But in the back of Jonathan’s mind, **the feeling doesn’t fade.** It **deepens.***

---

## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**

*A heavy **silence**. The only sound is the faint rustle of fabric as **Rebecca shifts in her sleep**, the rhythmic rise and fall of her breath.*

*Jonathan lies awake, staring at the ceiling, his body **tired but his mind restless**. His limbs feel heavy, his thoughts like static—an incessant, dull hum.*

*Then—**the sensation shifts.**  

Something **pulls.**  

His breath slows. His eyelids grow heavy. The world around him **tilts, dissolving into darkness.**  

---

## **INT. DUNGEON – ANCIENT ISRAEL – DREAM SEQUENCE**

*Jonathan **awakens suddenly—but he knows.**  

He **knows this is a dream.**  

But this time, **something is different.**  

*A **low, suffocating dampness** clings to the air. The stone walls are **slick with moisture**, a mixture of mold and decay soaking into the cracks. The only light comes from **torches flickering unevenly**, casting grotesque shadows that **dance against the walls.***  

*Jonathan’s wrists ache—**iron shackles bite into his skin.** The sensation is **too real.** His breath comes **sharp, uneven.**  

His body **remembers before his mind does.**  

And then it hits him.  

**Not just déjà vu.**  

**Recognition.**  

**He knows where he is. This is a dungeon.**  

A familiar **boom of a voice** cuts through the air.  

**GUARD (O.S.)**  
*"Bring the next one."*

*Jonathan’s **stomach tightens.** He turns his head—he isn’t alone.*  

*Rows of men **sit against the dungeon walls**, their faces **hollow, beaten, waiting.** Some **whisper prayers**, others stare blankly into the darkness. The air **smells of sweat, blood, and hopelessness.***  

*The **iron door** creaks open. A prisoner is **yanked to his feet**, his shackles dragging against the stone.*  

*Jonathan knows what comes next. But this time—**this time, he’s conscious.**  

He wants to move.  

He can’t.*  

*A raised **execution block** looms in the center of the dungeon—**a bloodstained stone platform**, worn from use. The prisoner is forced to **kneel**, his breathing ragged, his body trembling.*  

*A heavy-set **executioner**, clad in dark armor, lifts a **gleaming sword.** No hesitation. No mercy.*  

**SHHHHHRK!**  

*The **blade comes down**, and **the body crumples forward.** The head **rolls onto the stone**, its lifeless eyes still open.*  

*Jonathan gasps. He wants to wake up, but his body **stays trapped.** He feels **gravity anchoring him in place.**  

He **isn’t watching.**  

He **is living.**  

The guard turns—**his gaze lands on Jonathan.***  

**GUARD**  
*"Next."*

*Jonathan is **dragged forward.** His feet **scrape against the stone floor**, his body **powerless** against the pull of history.*  

He **has been here before.**  

And he **remembers how it ends.**  

*A shadow looms over him. The executioner grips his **shoulder**, forcing him **down onto the block.**  

**EXECUTIONER** *(low, rumbling)*  
*"Kneel."*

*Jonathan’s cheek **presses against the cold stone.** His eyes remain **locked on something just beyond the block.**  

*A **golden breastplate.** Resting on a pedestal, its **twelve stones dimly illuminated** in the flickering light.*  

Jonathan’s heart pounds harder.  

He tries to **move toward it, reach for it**, but **his body refuses.**  

The executioner’s grip tightens.  

The sword **rises.**  

Jonathan squeezes his eyes shut, **bracing for agony.**  

**Wake up, wake up WAKE UP!**  

The blade **comes down.**  

A flash of **white-hot pain.**  

---

## **INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT**

*Jonathan **jerks upright, gasping.** His body **lurches forward**, drenched in sweat, his breath coming in **short, ragged bursts.** His hands fly to his **neck.** He’s alive. But the pain still lingers—**a phantom sensation.***  

*Rebecca stirs beside him, frowning, her voice **thick with sleep.***  

**REBECCA** *(groggy)*  
*"Jon...? What happened?"*

*Jonathan stares ahead, his fingers still **hovering over his throat.** The weight of the dream **settles in his bones.***  

His voice is hoarse. Hollow.  

**JONATHAN** *(whispering)*  
*"I didn’t wake up this time."*

*Rebecca blinks, **now fully awake.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"What?"*

*Jonathan turns to her, his voice low, shaken.*  

**JONATHAN**  
*"I think I just died."*
