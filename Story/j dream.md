## **INT. JOHNATHAN & REBECCA’S APARTMENT – NIGHT**

*A clock **ticks softly**—**2:47 AM.** The city outside is **quiet**, save for the distant hum of passing cars. **Johnathan** shifts in his sleep, **his breath uneasy.** Sweat beads on his forehead. His fingers twitch.*

*Then—*

### **DREAM SEQUENCE: INT. ANCIENT COURTROOM – UNKNOWN TIME**

*A **massive stone hall** stretches before him—**columns carved with intricate symbols**, flickering **braziers lining the walls.** The air is thick with **incense and whispers**—not modern speech, but **an ancient tongue**, one he somehow… **understands.***

*Johnathan stands in the **center of the room**, dressed in **deep blue robes**, gold embroidery stitched along the seams. He feels the **weight of something heavy on his chest.***

*He looks down—**a breastplate**—**crafted from gold and embedded with twelve distinct gemstones.** The **Ephod.***

**UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)**  
*"Your judgment is at hand."*  

*Johnathan looks up. A **group of men**, robed in **dark ceremonial garments**, sit upon **a raised stone tribunal.** Their faces are **shadowed**, but their eyes… piercing. **Unforgiving.***

*One of them steps forward, pointing at him with a **staff marked with an emblem he doesn’t recognize.** His voice booms through the hall.*

---

**TRIBUNAL ELDER** *(echoing)*  
*"You have lost your way."*  

*"The people are led astray."*  

*"You will be stripped of your heritage—your name shall be forgotten."*  

*"Search... Search... search your fathers!"*  

---

*Johnathan’s pulse pounds. He tries to **speak**, but his voice **does not come.***

*The elder **lifts his staff**, striking it against the stone floor. A shockwave **ripples outward**—a force so strong, it **knocks Johnathan to his knees.***

*His **hands burn** as if being **branded.** He looks down—his **skin glows**, symbols **searing into his flesh.** A deep **pain rips through him**, like something being **torn away.***

*And then—**a flash.***  

*A **roaring fire** consumes the chamber, **engulfing the tribunal** in smoke and flame. The walls **collapse**—the roof **shatters**, sending debris **crashing around him.***

*Johnathan stumbles to his feet, chest **heaving**, eyes darting around—**he needs to run, escape.***

*But then—**he sees him.***  

*A **figure in the fire**. A man, his **face obscured by shadows**, yet **familiar**. He **stands amidst the flames**, **unmoving. Watching.***

**UNKNOWN FIGURE** *(deep, calm voice)*  
*"Find your name."*  

*"Find the truth."*  

*"And you will find me."*  

*Johnathan **gasps**—the **fire rushes toward him**—*

**FLASH TO WHITE.**

## **INT. JOHNATHAN’S BEDROOM – NIGHT**

*Johnathan **jerks awake**—**GASPING, SWEATING**, **eyes wild.** His chest **rises and falls sharply.** He grips the bedsheets like they’re the only thing anchoring him to reality.*

*Beside him, **Rebecca stirs**, groggy.*

**REBECCA** *(softly, still half-asleep)*  
*"Baby? …Another bad dream?"*  

*Johnathan doesn’t answer immediately. His hands **still tingle**, as if the **symbols were real**. As if the fire had truly touched him.*

*He swallows hard, **exhaling slowly.***

**JOHNATHAN** *(quietly, to himself)*  
*"Search my fathers..."*

*Rebecca shifts closer, **placing a gentle hand on his arm.***

**REBECCA**  
*"Hey… it’s just a dream."*  

*But **Johnathan isn’t sure anymore.***
