# FADE IN: Chapter 1 - Scene 1

## INT. DARK CHAMBER – DREAM SEQUENCE

*The sound of dripping water. The clinking of iron shackles.*

*A dimly lit chamber—**stone walls**, damp and ancient, like a **prison beneath a forgotten kingdom**. Torches flicker, casting eerie shadows across the bloodstained floor.*

*JOHNATHAN stands in the center, bound in iron chains. His chest rises and falls rapidly. He’s **dressed in camel skin rags**, breathing heavily, his mind racing. He doesn’t know how he got here—only that **he isn’t alone.***

*There are others… **dozens of men in chains** lined up beside him. Some **whisper prayers**, others **weep silently**. A few stare **blankly ahead**, their fate already accepted. The air is thick with the **stench of fear.***

*A booming voice echoes through the chamber—cold, commanding.*


**EXECUTIONER (O.S.)**  
*"Bring the next one."*

*A door creaks open, and **a guard yanks a prisoner from the line.** The man **struggles**—screaming, pleading—but it doesn’t matter. The guard **drags him forward**, past Johnathan, toward a **massive stone block** at the front of the chamber.*

*Johnathan watches, frozen, his pulse pounding in his ears. He **knows what’s coming.** He tries to move, but **his body won’t obey**. It’s as if he’s anchored in place, **forced to witness.***

*A HOODED EXECUTIONER steps forward, raising a massive **iron axe**. The prisoner’s head is forced down onto the **stone block**. He **screams for mercy.** The crowd of onlookers—nobles dressed in dark robes—**watches in silence.***

*Then—*

**SHHHHHRK!**  

*The blade comes down in a single, brutal motion. Blood splatters across the stone. The body **twitches once**—then goes still.*

*Johnathan **gasps**, heart hammering. He tries to look away, but he **can’t.** He can **feel the warmth of the blood** on his skin. It’s real. It’s all too real.*

*And then… the guard’s eyes turn to him.*

**GUARD**  
*"Next."*

*The chains around Johnathan’s wrists tighten. He’s being **pulled forward.** He **fights**, but it’s **futile.** His **feet scrape against the stone** as the guards drag him toward the execution block.*

*The prisoners beside him whisper urgently—some **cry his name.** Others **bow their heads.***

*A voice—a deep, unshakable voice—**whispers in Johnathan’s mind.***  



**UNKNOWN VOICE (O.S.)**  
*"You know how this ends."*  

*Johnathan **grits his teeth**, thrashing against the guards. But their grip is **unbreakable.***

*The stone block awaits. The **executioner’s blade glistens**, wet with blood.*

**EXECUTIONER**  
*"Kneel."*

*Johnathan is **forced down**. His **cheek presses against the cold stone**. The executioner **raises the axe** high above his head.*

*Johnathan’s **breath quickens.** This isn’t just a dream. **This has happened before.** He’s **been here.** He’s **felt this.***

*A thought cuts through his fear, clear as thunder—*

*"This is how John .....  died."*

*And then—*

**SHHHHHRK!**

# SMASH CUT TO:

## INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT

*Johnathan jolts **upright** in bed—**GASPING, DRENCHED IN SWEAT.** His breath comes in **ragged, panicked bursts.** The dim glow of a bedside lamp flickers on.*

*Beside him, **his girlfriend stirs**, her hand **instantly reaching for him.***  

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"Babe? Johnathan—hey, hey, it’s okay!"*  

*She **cups his face**, worry deep in her wide, **blue eyes**. Johnathan **doesn’t answer**—he’s **staring at his hands.** They **tremble.** He **swears he can still feel the chains.** The coldness of the stone. The final moment before the blade…*

*He shudders. Swallows hard. Finally **meets her gaze**.*

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"Was it the dream again?"*  

*Johnathan **runs a hand through his damp hair**. His **chest rises and falls, his heartbeat still erratic.** He finally nods, voice **hoarse.***

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Yeah. Same one."*  

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"Baby, that’s the third time this week."*  

*She moves closer, resting a **gentle hand on his arm.** Her concern is real—but Johnathan is barely listening. His **mind is still trapped** in that chamber, **that moment.***

*He forces a breath, leans forward, elbows on his knees.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"I’ve been having these dreams since I was a kid."*  

*He looks at her, **eyes shadowed.** There’s something deeper in his voice now—**a fear he won’t admit.** A truth he doesn’t want to say aloud.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"But this one… it’s getting worse."*

*She hesitates. Then—softly, carefully—*  

**GIRLFRIEND**  
*"What if it means something?"*

*Johnathan **stiffens.** His jaw tightens. He **shakes his head.***  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"It doesn’t."*

*But even as he says it—**he knows he’s lying.***

# FADE IN: Chapter 1 - Scene 2

## INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT

*The soft hum of the city outside. The bedside lamp **casts a warm glow**, flickering slightly as **Rebecca** watches Johnathan, concern still etched on her face.*

**REBECCA**  
*"You sure you're okay?"*

*Johnathan exhales slowly, rubbing his face with both hands. His body still **feels the weight** of the dream—**the chains, the cold stone, the final moment.** But he nods anyway.*

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Yeah… yeah, I’m good."*

*She **doesn’t believe him,** but she also knows pushing won’t get her anywhere. Instead, she **brushes a hand over his arm, squeezing gently.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"Come back to bed."*

*He hesitates, eyes lingering on the **dimly lit clock**—**4:37 AM.** Then, finally, he sighs and **slides back under the covers.** Rebecca turns off the lamp, settling against him.*

*As his eyes close, he whispers—almost to himself—*

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"It felt real."*

*Rebecca, half-asleep now, murmurs back—*

**REBECCA**  
*"Dreams always do."*

*But deep down, Johnathan **knows better.***

---

## INT. JOHNATHAN'S APARTMENT – MORNING

*A **sharp alarm buzzes.** The city is alive now—**cars honking, distant voices, the sizzle of bacon in a nearby apartment.** Rebecca moves around the kitchen, pouring coffee, while Johnathan finishes tying his **black techwear boots.***  

*She slides his mug toward him as he steps up to the counter, **grabbing a quick sip.** His face is still groggy, but he’s forcing himself into **work mode.** Rebecca eyes him over her own coffee.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Better sleep?"*

**JOHNATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Barely."*

*Before she can say anything else, **a car horn blares from outside.** Johnathan checks the time—**Malcolm’s here.** He downs the rest of his coffee, grabs his **EdenTech badge,** and heads for the door. Rebecca follows.*

---

## EXT. BROOKLYN STREET – MORNING

*A sleek **black sedan** idles at the curb. **Malcolm Grant**, always **calm under pressure**, leans against the driver’s side, scrolling through his phone. He looks up as **Johnathan and Rebecca step outside.***  

**MALCOLM** *(grinning)*  
*"You look like hell, man."*

*Rebecca **side-eyes Malcolm** as she walks toward her own car.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Make sure he actually stays awake at work."*

*MALCOLM smirks, **tipping an imaginary hat.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yes, ma’am. Keeping him in check is my full-time job."*

*Rebecca shakes her head with a **knowing smile** before getting into her car. Johnathan opens the **passenger door** and climbs in.*

---

## INT. MALCOLM’S CAR – DRIVING – MORNING

*The city rushes past as Malcolm **navigates the morning traffic.** A faint **hip-hop instrumental** plays low in the background. Johnathan leans back, still trying to shake off the **lingering unease** from the dream.*  

*MALCOLM glances over.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You good? You actually look worse than usual."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(scoffs, shaking his head)*  
*"Didn’t sleep much."*

*MALCOLM doesn’t push it. Instead, he shifts gears—both literally and figuratively.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yo, so you hear the buzz? The **promotion spot** is officially open."*

*That gets Johnathan’s attention. He **glances over**, expression neutral.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"You putting in for it?"*

*MALCOLM smirks but doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, he takes a turn, fingers **tapping the steering wheel.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"I mean… I should be a **top choice.** But you know how these corporate types are."*  

*Johnathan huffs a **short laugh, shaking his head.***  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"You saying it’s rigged?"*

**MALCOLM** *(shrugging)*  
*"I’m saying... **who they pick and why** ain't always about skill."*

*Johnathan leans his head against the **window**, watching the city blur past. He **knows Malcolm's right.** He also knows **he could gun for it himself.** But something in him hesitates.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"What about you? You throwing in?"*

*A pause. Johnathan exhales, rubbing his jaw before finally answering—*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Haven’t decided."*

*MALCOLM gives him a **knowing look** but lets it go. Instead, he **switches topics.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You hear about the **new project**?"*

**JOHNATHAN** *(glancing over)*  
*"The archaeology thing?"*

**MALCOLM** *(nodding)*  
*"Yeah. Word is, **EdenTech’s bringing in artifacts** from a major excavation overseas. Higher-ups been *real* hush-hush about it, but IT’s already on **security lockdown mode.** Whatever it is, it’s big."*

*Johnathan’s **brows furrow slightly.** The word **artifacts** stirs something... **uneasy.** He shifts in his seat.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"You know what they found?"*

*MALCOLM shakes his head, gripping the wheel a little tighter.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Not yet. But **Shaw’s running point.**"*

*A **brief silence** follows. They both know—**if Gregory Shaw is involved, it’s more than just old bones.***  

*The car slows as they **approach EdenTech headquarters**, the **massive glass skyscraper** reflecting the morning sun. Malcolm pulls into the underground parking lot, killing the engine.*

*MALCOLM leans back, throwing a smirk at Johnathan.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So… **promotion or not?**"*

*Johnathan unbuckles, **smirking faintly but keeping his answer to himself.** He pushes the door open and steps out.*

# FADE TO BLACK.


# FADE IN: Chapter 1 - Scene 3

## INT. EDENTECH HEADQUARTERS – MAIN LOBBY – MORNING

*A **futuristic corporate tower**, sleek and modern, its **glass façade reflecting the city skyline**. Inside, the lobby is a blend of **advanced security checkpoints, biometric scanners, and digital displays cycling through corporate achievements.** Employees in **tailored business attire** and **high-tech ID badges** move with purpose.*

*Johnathan and Malcolm step through the rotating glass doors. A **holographic interface** scans their badges as they pass security.*

**SECURITY AI (V.O.)**  
*"Welcome, Johnathan Reeves. Welcome, Malcolm Grant."*

*MALCOLM smirks, adjusting his blazer.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Gotta love a job that knows your name before you even say it."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(dryly)*  
*"Yeah. Real personal touch."*

*As they walk toward the elevators, a few **colleagues glance their way**, exchanging nods. **Everyone knows about the open promotion.** The air is charged with **silent competition.***  

**MALCOLM** *(leaning in, voice low)*  
*"They’re watching. All of them."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(smirks)*  
*"Let them. I plan on winning."*

*MALCOLM chuckles, shaking his head as they step into the **elevator**. The doors slide shut, and the soft hum of ascent fills the silence.*

---

## INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY FLOOR – MORNING

*The elevator doors open to reveal a **high-tech cybersecurity division**—**glass walls, digital security feeds, real-time cyber threat monitors** glowing in blue and green hues. A few employees glance up before returning to their workstations.*

*At the center of the floor, **TESSA VARGAS** sits at her desk, casually **spinning a stylus between her fingers** while skimming through **multiple security logs.** Dressed in a **stylish yet functional ensemble**, she gives off an air of **effortless confidence.***  

*As Johnathan and Malcolm approach, she leans back, eyebrow raised.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Look at you two—our very own **gladiators of corporate warfare.** Should I start placing bets?"*

*MALCOLM smirks, dropping into his chair.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Please. You already know who the house favorite is."*

**JOHNATHAN** *(grinning)*  
*"Yeah—me."*

*Tessa lets out a **mock gasp** before giving Johnathan a **playful shove** on the shoulder.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Oh? Big talk. But I dunno, John, you sure you can handle the pressure? Malcolm here’s already **rehearsing his victory speech.**"*

*MALCOLM gestures lazily, pretending to adjust a **nonexistent tie** as if addressing a boardroom.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to thank myself for always believing in me—"*

*Johnathan rolls his eyes, shaking his head with a **chuckle** as he sets down his bag and powers up his workstation. His monitor floods with **security alerts, protocol assignments, and project directives.** One notification catches his eye.*  

---

## ON SCREEN: **NEW PROJECT INITIATIVE – SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED**  

*Johnathan **narrows his eyes** as he clicks the notification. The system **flashes red**—ACCESS DENIED. The project name is simply listed as:*

### **"ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTAKE & SECURITY PROTOCOLS"**

*MALCOLM notices and leans over.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You seeing this?"*

*Johnathan **nods**, drumming his fingers on the desk. Tessa, now curious, **spins her chair toward them.***  

**TESSA**  
*"Ohhh, what’s got you two all serious?"*

*MALCOLM gestures toward Johnathan’s screen.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Rumor’s true. Something big is coming in."*

*Tessa frowns, sitting up straighter.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Big like **VIP big**, or big like **'we need to start asking questions' big?**"*

**JOHNATHAN** *(thoughtful)*  
*"Not sure yet. But if they’ve got **security access locked down** before the briefing, it’s serious."*

*MALCOLM smirks, arms crossed.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"They’re bringing **artifacts** in from a dig site in Israel. Some deal EdenTech locked in. Our job? **Make sure nothing leaks, nothing goes missing.**"*

*Tessa whistles low.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Huh. So they found something worth hiding."*

*MALCOLM shrugs.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Or something worth **protecting**."*

*A beat of silence. Johnathan stares at the **red-denied access screen**, a strange **unease curling in his gut.** He doesn’t know why, but something about this project feels... **different.***

*Before he can dwell on it, an **intercom announcement** crackles overhead.*  

---

## INTERCOM (V.O.):  
*"All division leads and select personnel, report to **Executive Conference Room 47** for **corporate briefing.**"*

*MALCOLM smirks, tossing his **badge lanyard** around his neck.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Guess we’ll be getting some answers after all."*

*Tessa watches as **Johnathan lingers**, still staring at his monitor. She leans in slightly.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Hey. You okay?"*

*Johnathan blinks, snapping out of his thoughts. He exhales and nods.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Yeah. Just thinking."*

**TESSA** *(grinning as she stands)*  
*"Dangerous habit, my friend."*

*MALCOLM claps Johnathan’s shoulder as they head for the exit.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Come on, man. Let’s see what kind of **ancient treasure** they’re dropping in our laps."*

*As the trio walks toward the **executive briefing room**, Johnathan can’t shake the feeling that whatever they’re about to learn—it’s only the beginning.*

# FADE TO BLACK.





# FADE IN: Chapter 1 - Scene 4

## INT. EDENTECH HEADQUARTERS – EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM – MORNING

*A **sleek, high-tech boardroom** with **a panoramic view of the city.** The room is dimly lit except for the glow of an **interactive holo-table** in the center. A **3D projection of an excavation site** flickers above it—**ancient ruins, stone walls, tunnels leading into darkness.***

*Sitting at the head of the table, **GREGORY SHAW**—CEO of EdenTech. His expression is unreadable, his **hands folded calmly** as he watches the others take their seats. Around him, a mix of **executives, cybersecurity leads, and key researchers** from the archaeology team sit in anticipation.*

*Johnathan, Malcolm, and Tessa settle into their seats near the **security team section.** The tension in the room is palpable.*

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**
*"We appreciate you all making time this morning. Let’s get straight to it."*

*He gestures toward **DR. MARCUS STRAUSS**, a lead **archaeologist** in his late 50s, dressed in **practical fieldwear** despite the corporate setting. Strauss clears his throat, tapping at the **holo-table**. The **3D projection zooms in** on a specific section of the ruins.*

---

## ON SCREEN:  
### **PROJECT ATHENA – EXCAVATION SITE: JERUSALEM, ISRAEL**  
### **LOCATION: KING HEROD'S WALL & TEMPLE PERIMETER**  
### **CLASSIFICATION: SECURED ARTIFACTS INTAKE**  

---

*Johnathan **leans forward**, eyes narrowing slightly. **This isn’t just any dig.***

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"EdenTech has secured exclusive research access to an **archaeological zone near the remnants of King Herod’s temple wall.** After extensive negotiations with Israeli authorities, we’ve been granted **the first corporate-backed excavation rights** in this sector."*

*Tessa **raises a brow, exchanging a look with Johnathan.** Corporate-backed? That’s rare.*  

*MALCOLM smirks slightly, whispering under his breath—*

**MALCOLM** *(low voice)*  
*"Sounds expensive."*

**GREGORY SHAW** *(calmly, without looking up)*  
*"It was."*

*Silence settles for a brief moment before **Strauss continues.***  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Our team has uncovered **several artifacts** that will be transferred here for **analysis and preservation.** Your division will oversee the **cybersecurity and logistical protocols** for securing these artifacts during their transport and housing in EdenTech’s private archive."*

*Tessa leans back slightly, arms crossed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"And what exactly are we guarding?"*

---

## ON SCREEN: **LISTED ARTIFACTS FOR TRANSPORT**

- **Ancient bronze relics** with unknown engravings  
- **Damaged scroll fragments** encased in protective resin  
- **Gold-plated ceremonial object** (partially restored)  
- **A piece of an ornamental breastplate** (unidentified origin)  

---

*Johnathan stares at the last item, something about it **nagging at his subconscious.** The vague description bothers him.*  

**JOHNATHAN** *(quietly, to himself)*  
*"Ornamental breastplate?"*

*MALCOLM, skimming the list, frowns slightly.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"That last one seems… oddly specific."*

**DR. STRAUSS** *(ignoring the comment, moving on)*  
*"Each item will undergo a **multi-stage authentication process** to determine historical significance and proper handling. Until further notice, these artifacts will remain **off-record to external entities.**"*

*Johnathan glances at Shaw, who **hasn’t spoken much.** But his gaze is sharp, watchful. Like he’s **measuring everyone’s reactions.***  

---

## **GREGORY SHAW (CEO)**
*"Now, as for your responsibilities—"*

*He nods toward the **head of the cybersecurity division**, MARCUS LANCASTER, who takes over.*

*MARCUS, a **seasoned veteran in security management**, speaks with precision.*  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"Johnathan. Malcolm. Tessa. Your team will be leading the **internal security integration** for this project. That means—**surveillance, access logs, breach detection.** No one outside this room is to have clearance."*

*Johnathan and Malcolm exchange a look. **This just got serious.***  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"We’ll be implementing **classified protocols** for digital containment. That includes **restricted server access, biometric entry for physical storage zones, and live threat analysis.**"*

**TESSA** *(leaning forward)*  
*"So we’re treating this like **a national security asset**?"*

**GREGORY SHAW** *(calmly)*  
*"That would be an accurate comparison."*

*Another beat of **silence.** Something about Shaw’s **tone** makes the entire room feel colder. Johnathan **studies him carefully.***  

*MALCOLM, ever the skeptic, exhales sharply.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"So what aren’t we being told?"*

*Shaw finally looks up, his gaze locking onto Malcolm’s with a faint, unreadable smirk.*  

**GREGORY SHAW**  
*"Nothing you need to concern yourself with at this stage."*

*MALCOLM holds his stare for a moment before **leaning back in his chair**, nodding slowly.*  

*Tessa **glances at Johnathan**, seeing the way he’s still looking at the **artifact list on the screen.** He seems... **drawn to it.***  

---

## **INTERCOM (V.O.)**  
*"Security transport for Project Athena will commence in **48 hours.** All lead personnel prepare protocols accordingly."*

*MARCUS nods, closing the **briefing session.***  

**MARCUS LANCASTER**  
*"That’s all for now. Get to work."*

*Chairs slide back. Executives file out. Strauss murmurs something to a fellow researcher. Shaw stands, straightens his **tailored suit**, and exits without another word.*  

---

## INT. EDENTECH – HALLWAY – MOMENTS LATER  

*Tessa, Malcolm, and Johnathan **walk back toward their division**, the weight of the meeting **lingering.***

*MALCOLM scoffs, running a hand over his jaw.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"You’re telling me we’re locking down **ancient artifacts** like they’re **nuclear launch codes**? Something’s off."*

**TESSA** *(glancing at Johnathan)*  
*"You’ve been quiet."*

*Johnathan stops mid-step, still processing. Something about **that ornamental breastplate.** His gut tells him **this isn’t just a relic.***

**JOHNATHAN** *(finally speaking, voice low)*  
*"I think this is bigger than we realize."*

*MALCOLM gives him a look, smirking slightly.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah? You gonna start believing in **ancient curses and lost treasures** now?"*

*Johnathan doesn’t answer. He just **keeps walking.** The image of the **breastplate** still lingers in his mind… **as if he’s seen it before.***  

# FADE TO BLACK.






# FADE IN: Chapter 1 - Scene 5

## INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – AFTERNOON

*A low hum of **server racks** fills the air. Rows of **high-tech workstations** glow under dimmed blue lights, each screen flashing with **coding interfaces, network monitoring tools, and security protocols in progress.** Large **interactive displays** map out access routes and encryption layers for the upcoming **artifact transfer.***

*Johnathan, Tessa, and Malcolm stand near the **central operations hub**, reviewing the **latest system configurations** while their team of **engineers and analysts** works around them.*

*Tessa taps a few keys on a **touchscreen panel, scanning the system logs.***  

**TESSA**  
*"Alright, so we’re running a **segmented security model**—only **biometric clearance and direct ID authentication** can access the archives. Even **Shaw himself** has to log in with dual verification."*

*MALCOLM, arms crossed, nods while glancing at the **encryption firewall logs.***  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Fine. But what about external threats? If someone tries **breaching from an outside network**, we need an **instant kill switch** before data gets compromised."*

*Johnathan, typing rapidly on his console, speaks without looking up.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"I’m implementing a **multi-tiered fail-safe**. If an unauthorized entity tries to force their way in, the **server partitions itself**, isolating the breach before wiping volatile data."*

*Tessa whistles, clearly impressed.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Damn. You trying to build a digital Fort Knox?"*

**JOHNATHAN** *(smirking, still typing)*  
*"If I do my job right, even **we** won’t be able to break in without clearance."*

*MALCOLM, skeptical, leans over to check Johnathan’s screen.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Yeah? What about **internal threats**?"*

*Tessa leans back in her chair, arms behind her head.*  

**TESSA**  
*"See, that’s the real issue. We can guard **against the world**, but if someone **inside EdenTech** decides to play dirty? That’s a whole different problem."*

*MALCOLM nods, rubbing his chin.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Exactly. And we both know **this company’s got secrets.** Hell, we’re getting locked out of half the damn logs."*

*Johnathan doesn’t respond immediately. He knows Malcolm is right. This isn’t **just a security job**—there’s a level of **secrecy** even they aren’t being told. But instead of voicing his concern, he refocuses on his screen.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Then we build a system that makes internal leaks **traceable**. If someone **inside** tries to bypass security, we **track them in real time.**"*

*Tessa raises a brow, intrigued.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Oh? You thinking **counter-surveillance?**"*

*MALCOLM chuckles, shaking his head.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"My man’s out here setting traps before we even catch a rat."*

*Johnathan smirks but keeps his focus on the monitor.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Better safe than sorry."*

## **ON SCREEN – SECURITY PROTOCOLS IN PROGRESS:**

- **Server Partitioning Active** ✅  
- **Multi-Layered Biometric Access** ✅  
- **Live Threat Monitoring** ✅  
- **Counter-Surveillance Logs Activated** ✅  

---

*Tessa claps her hands together, pushing away from her workstation.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Alright, well… this is officially the **most secure system we’ve ever built.** Unless someone’s got magic, we should be good."*

*MALCOLM stretches, rolling his shoulders.*  

**MALCOLM**  
*"Magic? Man, you been watching too many movies."*

*Tessa smirks, standing up.*  

**TESSA**  
*"And you don’t watch enough."*

*MALCOLM shakes his head as **the clock on the wall flashes 6:45 PM.** The workday is wrapping up. Engineers are **logging off, stretching, grabbing their stuff.** The security protocols are in place, and now, it’s just a matter of **waiting for the artifacts to arrive.***  

**MALCOLM** *(grabbing his bag)*  
*"Alright, I’m out. I got a gym session, then I’m hitting the bar. You in?"*

*Johnathan shakes his head, shutting down his station.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Nah, I’m heading home."*

*Tessa shrugs.*  

**TESSA**  
*"Suit yourself, bossman. Try not to dream about **firewalls and intrusion logs** tonight."*

*Johnathan smirks, slinging his bag over his shoulder.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"No promises."*

---

## INT. JOHNATHAN & REBECCA'S APARTMENT – NIGHT  

*Johnathan unlocks the door, stepping inside to the **soft glow of kitchen lights.** The smell of **roasted vegetables and seared meat** lingers in the air. Rebecca, dressed in **casual homewear**, moves around the kitchen, plating their dinner.*

*She looks up and smiles as he enters.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Perfect timing. I was just about to eat without you."*

*Johnathan smirks, dropping his bag by the couch.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Long day?"*

**REBECCA** *(nodding)*  
*"You have no idea. You?"*

*Johnathan exhales, running a hand through his hair.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Same. System setups, security tests, the usual corporate paranoia."*

*Rebecca hands him a plate, studying him for a second.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"You look like you’re still thinking about work."*

*Johnathan hesitates, then shakes his head with a small chuckle.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Yeah, well… it’s **a lot** right now."*

*Rebecca tilts her head slightly.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Is it about the promotion?"*

*Johnathan hesitates before nodding.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Partially. And also this **new project we’re working on.** It’s… different."*

*Rebecca slides into a seat across from him, picking up her fork.*  

**REBECCA**  
*"Different how?"*

*Johnathan **pauses**, debating whether to share the full truth. The **artifact list, the security protocols, the secrecy.** Finally, he just sighs, shaking his head.*  

**JOHNATHAN**  
*"Just different."*

*Rebecca watches him for a beat before deciding not to press further. Instead, she **reaches over, resting a hand on his.***  

**REBECCA**  
*"Well, whatever it is, just remember—you don’t have to carry everything on your own."*

*Johnathan looks at her, her **blue eyes steady, reassuring.** The weight on his shoulders **feels a little lighter.***  

**JOHNATHAN** *(softly)*  
*"I know."*

*A comfortable silence settles as they eat. The **city hums softly beyond the windows.** The tension from work **lingers in the back of his mind**… but for now, he lets himself **just be here.***  

# FADE TO BLACK.






## **INT. EDENTECH – CYBERSECURITY DIVISION – LATE NIGHT**

*A dim glow from **monitors and security feeds** illuminates the otherwise empty office. The floor is nearly deserted—most employees have left for the night. **Tessa Vargas**, still at her workstation, leans back in her chair, chewing on a pen cap as she scrolls through layers of **encrypted files** on her **holo-screen**.*  

*The **system hums softly**, displaying endless lines of **authorization logs and classified data archives**. Every few seconds, **Tessa glances over her shoulder**, half-expecting someone to walk in. The files she’s looking through… **she shouldn’t be looking at.***  

*Her fingers dance over the keys, **bypassing basic firewalls**, slipping past **security alerts** like a ghost. She mutters to herself—*  

### **TESSA** *(low voice)*  
*"Alright, let’s see what these corporate creeps don’t want us knowing."*  

*The **screen flickers**, the **EdenTech security database** adjusting to her **clearance bypass**. She exhales slowly—her heart pounds. She’s done **covert digging before**, but this is different.*  

*Finally, a **project archive** pops up—**old, buried records**, hidden under **obsolete classification codes**.*

## **ON SCREEN:**  
### **PROJECT: ATHENA – HISTORICAL ACQUISITIONS**  
**Date:** March 2017  
**Status:** Terminated  
**Lead Investigator:** Gregory Shaw  
**Description:** Recovery & Containment of High-Risk Artifacts  
**Security Level:** Black Class Authorization  

---

*Tessa squints. **Black Class Authorization?** That’s the **highest clearance level in the company**. Even **department heads don’t get access** to those files.*  

*Her cursor hovers over the **"Open Detailed Report"** button. She hesitates.*  

*"Screw it."*  

*She clicks.*  

*Instantly, the screen **blurs with a red security warning**—*  

---

## **WARNING: ACCESS RESTRICTED. ADMINISTRATIVE OVERRIDE REQUIRED.**  
## **ATTEMPT LOGGED.**  
## **REPORTING TO SECURITY MAINFRAME.**  
## **DISCONNECTING IN 10 SECONDS.**  

---

### **TESSA** *(muttering)*  
*"Shit."*  

*She **yanks her connection line**, **killing the system feed** just before the security lockout activates. The screen **fades to black**, and for a second, there’s **nothing but silence**.*  

*Then, her **workstation reboots itself.** Like nothing ever happened.*  

*But she knows better.*  

*Tessa leans back, rubbing her face. Her mind races—what the hell did she just **almost see**?*  

*Her eyes flick toward the **security logs** she copied just before the system locked her out.*

## **ON SCREEN – RECOVERED DATA FRAGMENT:**  
#### **PROJECT: ATHENA – TERMINATION ORDER**  
- **Primary Objective:** Secure artifacts of theological and historical significance.  
- **Compromise Report:** Unauthorized parties obtained knowledge of artifact’s properties.  
- **Termination Justification:** Risk of public awareness concerning certain relics and their… **“inherent anomalies.”**  
- **Final Entry: March 29, 2017 – Last confirmed artifact location… Jerusalem dig site.**  

---

*Tessa **narrows her eyes**. Her gut was right—**this project isn’t new.** Something like this has been done before. And whatever was found in 2017…*  

*It was **shut down. Covered up.***  

*Tessa exhales, shutting her laptop. She suddenly doesn’t feel so comfortable being **alone in the office.***  










# **FADE IN:** Chapter 2:Scene 1

## **EXT. JERUSALEM – HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – NIGHT**

*A **dusty wind** moves through the excavation site, the remnants of **Herod’s Temple** standing as a **monument of history and ruin.** The air is thick with the scent of **earth and stone**, the weight of time pressing down on the dig team as they work beneath a canopy of floodlights.*

*Among the ruins, scaffolding and dig machinery surround the **uncovered foundations** of what was once the **Second Temple of Jerusalem**—commissioned by **King Herod the Great** over **two thousand years ago.***  

*A **temporary research tent** flaps in the night breeze, its walls covered in **historical schematics and satellite imagery**. Inside, a **holographic display** maps out the excavation site, showing layers of the temple’s structure buried beneath centuries of rubble.*

---

## **INT. TEMPORARY FIELD HQ – NIGHT**

*Dr. **Marcus Strauss** stands over a **historical reconstruction model**, his hands resting on the edge of the table. His eyes trace the **blueprint of Herod’s Temple**, studying the once-magnificent structure.*  

*A younger researcher, **Dr. Eva Mendez**, steps forward, her voice even but eager.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"I still can’t believe we’re standing in the heart of Herod’s Temple. Do you realize what this place was?"*

*Strauss exhales, adjusting his glasses. His voice is calm, methodical.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"It was **a statement of power.** A symbol of **Herod’s dominion** over Judea. But also a place of **betrayal, rebellion, and prophecy.**"*

*Dr. Mendez leans against the table, arms crossed.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Herod didn’t build this for faith. He built it to **secure his rule**."*

*Strauss nods, eyes still on the **holo-display** as images of the temple’s **historical events** cycle through.*  

---

## **ON SCREEN – HISTORY OF HEROD’S TEMPLE:**
- **37 BCE** – **Herod the Great** is installed as **King of Judea** by Rome. He **commissions** the expansion of the Second Temple.  
- **20 BCE** – The **temple is rebuilt** with massive stone walls and gold-covered sanctuaries, but it remains under **Roman oversight.**  
- **4 BCE** – After Herod’s death, Judea is thrown into unrest. The temple becomes a **center of resistance against Roman occupation.**  
- **66 CE** – The **Jewish Revolt** begins; the temple is turned into a fortress.  
- **70 CE** – The temple is **destroyed by Roman forces**, fulfilling the prophecy of its downfall. Only the **Western Wall** remains.  

---

*Mendez tilts her head, studying the last **holo-image**—the **Roman siege**, flames rising from the temple’s remains.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(softly)*  
*"So much power… and yet it still fell."*

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"As all kingdoms do."*  

*A sharp **beep** from his radio cuts the moment short.*  

**FIELD ARCHAEOLOGIST (V.O.)** *(urgent, over radio)*  
*"Dr. Strauss, we’ve found something. You need to see this."*  

*Strauss and Mendez **exchange a glance** before heading toward the dig site.*

---

## **EXT. HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – MAIN EXCAVATION AREA – NIGHT**

*A team of **archaeologists and preservationists** gathers around a **partially unearthed vault**, deep within the **foundation of Herod’s Temple.** The **ancient stone casing** has been **sealed for centuries**, its inscriptions **barely legible** beneath layers of dust and time.*  

*A nervous **field assistant** wipes sweat from his forehead as Strauss and Mendez arrive.*  

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"We were stabilizing the lower chamber when we uncovered this vault. It doesn’t match the Roman-era structures—it’s **older**."*

*Mendez crouches beside the stone lid, brushing away **centuries of debris.** Her eyes narrow as she deciphers the faded engravings.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(reading)*  
*"High Priest... garments… preserved... holy relics?"*  

*Strauss watches as another **team member carefully pries the lid open.** The stone **groans in protest**, releasing a **stale gust of air**—the first breath this chamber has taken in **two thousand years.***  

---

## **INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – NIGHT**

*Inside the vault, **several artifacts lay preserved in the dust**—small fragments of history untouched by time. The team moves carefully, cataloging each discovery.*  

### **ITEMS FOUND IN THE VAULT:**
✔ **A golden goblet** – engraved with **priestly symbols**, possibly used in **rituals of purification.**  
✔ **A set of weighted scales** – small, but **perfectly balanced**, believed to have been used in **temple offerings.**  
✔ **A faded scroll fragment** – wrapped in deteriorating leather, the text too fragile to decipher.  
✔ **A tattered garment** – aged beyond recognition, but **fibers reveal it to be camel’s hair.**  

*Mendez holds up the **camel’s hair garment**, frowning.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"This… isn’t temple priest attire."*

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"Camel’s hair? Wasn’t that what the **Nazarenes and desert prophets** wore?"*  

*Strauss says nothing. His fingers hover over the next discovery—a **breastplate, small and unassuming, tarnished by time.***  

*Unlike the other artifacts, it isn’t gold-plated or extravagant. It looks… **simple. Ancient.** Forgotten.*  

---

## **DR. STRAUSS** *(thoughtful, to himself)*  
*"And yet… it’s here."*  

*Mendez looks up from her notes.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Should we mark it for high priority?"*  

*Strauss hesitates, then shakes his head.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"No. It’s not the primary find."*  

*He turns to the rest of the team.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Log everything. Secure the vault. We’ll begin full preservation at dawn."*  

*Mendez nods, but something **lingers** in her gaze as she watches Strauss walk away. The **camel’s hair garment, the weighted scales, the breastplate**—small things, unimportant at first glance. And yet...** they were hidden together.***

---

## **EXT. DIG SITE – MOMENTS LATER**

*The wind picks up as Strauss steps away from the vault, radioing back to EdenTech’s headquarters.*  

---

## **ON RADIO:**
**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"We have the artifacts. Primary finds include ritual objects and priestly relics. We’ll send full documentation within 48 hours."*

*A brief **silence** follows before a **calm, authoritative voice** responds over the line.*  

**GREGORY SHAW (V.O.)** *(from EdenTech HQ)*  
*"Understood. Ensure the highest discretion, Dr. Strauss. No leaks. No outside involvement."*  

*Strauss exhales, nodding slightly.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Of course."*  

---

*As he ends the call, the **floodlights flicker**, casting **long shadows** over the ruins. The excavation continues, but something about this discovery **feels different.**  

*Something buried in the past, waiting to be understood. Or… waiting to be found.***  

# **FADE TO BLACK.**
