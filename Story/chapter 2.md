## **EXT. JERUSALEM – HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – NIGHT**

*A **dusty wind** moves through the excavation site, the remnants of **Herod’s Temple** standing as a **monument of history and ruin.** The air is thick with the scent of **earth and stone**, the weight of time pressing down on the dig team as they work beneath a canopy of floodlights.*

*Among the ruins, scaffolding and dig machinery surround the **uncovered foundations** of what was once the **Second Temple of Jerusalem**—commissioned by **King Herod the Great** over **two thousand years ago.***  

*A **temporary research tent** flaps in the night breeze, its walls covered in **historical schematics and satellite imagery**. Inside, a **holographic display** maps out the excavation site, showing layers of the temple’s structure buried beneath centuries of rubble.*

## **INT. TEMPORARY FIELD HQ – NIGHT**

*Dr. **Marcus Strauss** stands over a **historical reconstruction model**, his hands resting on the edge of the table. His eyes trace the **blueprint of Herod’s Temple**, studying the once-magnificent structure.*  

*A younger researcher, **Dr. Eva Mendez**, steps forward, her voice even but eager.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"I still can’t believe we’re standing in the heart of Herod’s Temple. Do you realize what this place was?"*

*Strauss exhales, adjusting his glasses. His voice is calm, methodical.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"It was **a statement of power.** A symbol of **Herod’s dominion** over Judea. But also a place of **betrayal, rebellion, and prophecy.**"*

*Dr. Mendez leans against the table, arms crossed.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Herod didn’t build this for faith. He built it to **secure his rule**."*

*Strauss nods, eyes still on the **holo-display** as images of the temple’s **historical events** cycle through.*

## **ON SCREEN – HISTORY OF HEROD’S TEMPLE:**
- **37 BCE** – **Herod the Great** is installed as **King of Judea** by Rome. He **commissions** the expansion of the Second Temple.  
- **20 BCE** – The **temple is rebuilt** with massive stone walls and gold-covered sanctuaries, but it remains under **Roman oversight.**  
- **4 BCE** – After Herod’s death, Judea is thrown into unrest. The temple becomes a **center of resistance against Roman occupation.**  
- **66 CE** – The **Jewish Revolt** begins; the temple is turned into a fortress.  
- **70 CE** – The temple is **destroyed by Roman forces**, fulfilling the prophecy of its downfall. Only the **Western Wall** remains.

*Mendez tilts her head, studying the last **holo-image**—the **Roman siege**, flames rising from the temple’s remains.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(softly)*  
*"So much power… and yet it still fell."*

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"As all kingdoms do."*  

*A sharp **beep** from his radio cuts the moment short.*  

**FIELD ARCHAEOLOGIST (V.O.)** *(urgent, over radio)*  
*"Dr. Strauss, we’ve found something. You need to see this."*  

*Strauss and Mendez **exchange a glance** before heading toward the dig site.*

---

## **EXT. HEROD’S TEMPLE DIG SITE – MAIN EXCAVATION AREA – NIGHT**

*A team of **archaeologists and preservationists** gathers around a **partially unearthed vault**, deep within the **foundation of Herod’s Temple.** The **ancient stone casing** has been **sealed for centuries**, its inscriptions **barely legible** beneath layers of dust and time.*  

*A nervous **field assistant** wipes sweat from his forehead as Strauss and Mendez arrive.*  

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"We were stabilizing the lower chamber when we uncovered this vault. It doesn’t match the Roman-era structures—it’s **older**."*

*Mendez crouches beside the stone lid, brushing away **centuries of debris.** Her eyes narrow as she deciphers the faded engravings.*  

**DR. MENDEZ** *(reading)*  
*"High Priest... garments… preserved... holy relics?"*  

*Strauss watches as another **team member carefully pries the lid open.** The stone **groans in protest**, releasing a **stale gust of air**—the first breath this chamber has taken in **two thousand years.***  

---

## **INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER – NIGHT**

*Inside the vault, **several artifacts lay preserved in the dust**—small fragments of history untouched by time. The team moves carefully, cataloging each discovery.*  

### **ITEMS FOUND IN THE VAULT:**
✔ **A golden goblet** – engraved with **priestly symbols**, possibly used in **rituals of purification.**  
✔ **A set of weighted scales** – small, but **perfectly balanced**, believed to have been used in **temple offerings.**  
✔ **A faded scroll fragment** – wrapped in deteriorating leather, the text too fragile to decipher.  
✔ **A tattered garment** – aged beyond recognition, but **fibers reveal it to be camel’s hair.**  

*Mendez holds up the **camel’s hair garment**, frowning.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"This… isn’t temple priest attire."*

**FIELD ASSISTANT**  
*"Camel’s hair? Wasn’t that what the **Nazarenes and desert prophets** wore?"*  

*Strauss says nothing. His fingers hover over the next discovery—a **breastplate, small and unassuming, tarnished by time.***  

*Unlike the other artifacts, it isn’t gold-plated or extravagant. It looks… **simple. Ancient.** Forgotten.*  

---

## **DR. STRAUSS** *(thoughtful, to himself)*  
*"And yet… it’s here."*  

*Mendez looks up from her notes.*  

**DR. MENDEZ**  
*"Should we mark it for high priority?"*  

*Strauss hesitates, then shakes his head.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"No. It’s not the primary find."*  

*He turns to the rest of the team.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Log everything. Secure the vault. We’ll begin full preservation at dawn."*  

*Mendez nods, but something **lingers** in her gaze as she watches Strauss walk away. The **camel’s hair garment, the weighted scales, the breastplate**—small things, unimportant at first glance. And yet...** they were hidden together.***

---

## **EXT. DIG SITE – MOMENTS LATER**

*The wind picks up as Strauss steps away from the vault, radioing back to EdenTech’s headquarters.*  

---

## **ON RADIO:**
**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"We have the artifacts. Primary finds include ritual objects and priestly relics. We’ll send full documentation within 48 hours."*

*A brief **silence** follows before a **calm, authoritative voice** responds over the line.*  

**GREGORY SHAW (V.O.)** *(from EdenTech HQ)*  
*"Understood. Ensure the highest discretion, Dr. Strauss. No leaks. No outside involvement."*  

*Strauss exhales, nodding slightly.*  

**DR. STRAUSS**  
*"Of course."*  

---

*As he ends the call, the **floodlights flicker**, casting **long shadows** over the ruins. The excavation continues, but something about this discovery **feels different.**  

*Something buried in the past, waiting to be understood. Or… waiting to be found.***
